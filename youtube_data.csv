sLdm8ejXoJ4,PARIS TRAVEL VLOG | Indian Girl Traveling Solo in Paris! 🇫🇷 #KikiInParis Ep 1,"Bonjour from Paris! I'm on a one month long solo trip in Europe, and I'm starting my solo trip with Paris in France! Here's how I spent my first day in Paris, walking around the city and exploring the popular attractions. I had some nice coffee in a Parisian cafe, figured out the metro in Paris, walked down Champs Elysees, saw the Arc de Triomphe, Galeries Lafayette and all the Christmas decoration there plus a stunning view of the Eiffel Tower from the roof, walked by the Seine, The Louvre and of course the Eiffel Tower from up close! This was such a great first day in Paris and I'm already in love with this city! Excited to be traveling solo in Paris and in Europe!

11aKPY5UJrM,First Impressions of India 🇮🇳 / Foreigners travelling in India,"Help us reach our goal of 500,000 Followers on Facebook:
👉 https://www.facebook.com/thebuddymoon

This video is about our first impressions of Delhi, India. This is a city we have always wanted to visit and we cannot believe that we actually got to explore Delhi.

Of course, we started our trip on a Rikshaw. We headed towards the metro in order to take us from the south of Delhi to the north. We had to take 2 metro lines in order to get there but the Delhi train system is designed so well, with trains going all over the city, so it was no problem at all.

We began exploring Delhi by starting at the Red Fort. The Red Fort was built and designed by Shah Jahan, an Emperor during the Mughal Era. He is the same Emperor that built the Tag Mahal for his wife. The red fort was one of the biggest forts here in India and is a must when visiting Delhi.

Thereafter we saw a little theme park right next to the fort and were quite curious as to what rides they had and if we could take one. Once we had walked around the park, we found a ride that only cost INR 50 per person and decided to go on it. Let's just say that we haven't done anything as crazy as this in a long time. FYI, the safety bar was tied with a rope :0

We then head into Chandi Chowk where found some Jalebi, a popular sweet dish here in India.
Jalebi is a popular sweet snack in south and west Asia, Africa, and Mauritius. It goes by many names, including jilapi, zelepi, jilebi, jilipi, zulbia, jerry, mushabak, z’labia, or zalabia. Is basically dough that they squeeze out into hot oil in the shape of a circle. Once it's fried, they dunk it in syrup to give the Jalebi taste. They added condensed milk to ours so you can only imagine what it tastes like.

As it was afternoon, we headed to a place called Haldirams, a popular shop in India, where we decided to try some Chole Bhature. Chole bhature is a food dish popular in the Northern areas of the Indian subcontinent. It is a combination of chana masala and bhatura/puri, a deep-fried bread made from maida.

Once our tummies were full, we climbed onto a bicycle rikshaw in order to go to Jama Masjid. Jama Masjid is an Old mosque in Delhi where you can actually climb to the top of one of the minarets. We thought the bicycle rikshaw would be relaxing, but with so much traffic and people walking everywhere, it was more chaotic than relaxing.  With the sounds of scooters hooting and people shouting, it was an experience on its own.

Finally, we made it to Jama Masjid. We headed up to the top of the minaret to see the views of Delhi. Once we got to the top, things got crazy. So many people were squished into this small little place with nowhere to stand, and it had us all thinking, why are we here? But once we saw the views of Delhi, we understood!

More about Tripoto: 
Some people are born with an addiction to explore the world. They are happiest when they lost in a new city, exploring a hidden path or pushing the boundaries of their comfort zone. They breathe in the deepest when they are surrounded by crisp mountain air and they curl their toes in the pristine sands of peaceful beaches. And it is a tribe of such wanderers that has come together to create a community called Tripoto. 

Tripoto is one of the largest communities of travelers in the world. Travelers post breathtaking photographs, mind-blowing blogs and goosebump-inducing videos on our platforms and share them to inspire fellow travelers.

That’s not all, going above and beyond recommendations, Tripoto also helps you plan the perfect vacation with our team of partner-agents who customise travel packages to suit your need and offer unmatched prices. Choose from a host of options and pick the one that suits your mood and doesn’t stretch your wallet.

And if you are planning a trip to this side of Goa, I’ve got you covered with all kinds of travel recommendations. From hikes, and cycle tours to the most beautiful and empty beaches and experiencing Goa in an EV! 

We'll immerse ourselves in the hidden treasures of South Goa, all while cruising in the eco-friendly and cost-efficient Tata Tiago EV. We'll set off on an exhilarating coastal journey, with golden beaches, swaying palm trees, and crystal-clear waters as our backdrop.

But that's not all. In this video we’ll hike through lush jungles & small rivers to discover a hidden waterfall, its cascading waters providing a serene escape with The Local Beat. And brace yourself for an electric bike adventure, guided by the team of B-Live, as we venture into the secluded parts of Cansaulim rarely seen by tourists. 

I’ll also take you to Fatarade Beach and Velaao Beach for the most breathtaking sunsets. 

Join me as we embrace the spirit of Goa, creating memories & get ready to be enchanted by the magic of South Goa with TATA Tiago EV!

_lcOX55Ef70,Solo in Paro Bhutan | Tiger&#39;s Nest visit | Bhutan Travel Guide | Bhutan Series Ep 1 | Tanya Khanijow,"Here’s presenting the first part of the Bhutan Series Episode in Paro. I went straight to Paro as first part of my road trip in the country. The drive from Phuntsholing took about 4 hours. 
 
The entire budget of my Bhutan trip was close to  INR 25k. You can carry cash everywhere in Indian currency in Bhutan as it is accepted. Some things about Paro below:

1. The place where I stayed at in Paro is called Ama’s Village Lodge. You can book the place here - https://www.booking.com/s/32_8/e9f2a7ab

2.  The cost of entry to Taktsang Goempa is INR 500 and a round trip with any driver will cost INR 1000 from your lodge

3. You can contact Mr. Yonten Norbu for driving you around Bhutan if you are visiting. His number is +975 17672515 , my experience with him was extremely nice. He was a perfect gentleman who ensured my safety and also made sure my experience in Bhutan was memorable.
 
4. If you are visiting Bhutan, I would highly advice you to get a local sim for contacting tour agencies or driver. A local sim will be available for INR 200 at Phuntsholing. 

5. Other places that you can visit in Paro are - Paro Dzong and you can get a Hot Stone bath which is very popular in the area

From large island groups to mountains and tropical rainforest, the country’s geography is every bit as diverse. What’s more, Malaysia is a unique country in that is divided into two main landmasses. West Malaysia occupies the southern half of a peninsula shared with Thailand, while East Malaysia is situated on the Borneo island.

s3LZ1xXYTlI,Journey Through Israel - Travel Documentary,"Israel means a lot of different things to many people, and is one of the most diverse and dynamic countries in the world. Even though it’s often associated with political unrest and conflict, it’s also a beautiful place to travel to, with spectacular natural beauty, lively cities, ancient historic sites, incredible cuisine, and friendly, welcoming people. 

On this journey, I’m traveling through the Holy Land, a region important to the three main monotheistic religions, and what is known today as Israel and Palestine. 

In this episode, I’m exploring Israel, a country that was established in 1948, but is located in a region that has been at the crossroads of religions and cultures for many centuries. From the beautiful beaches and dynamic streets of modern Tel Aviv, to the religious landmarks and atmospheric alleys of the Old City of Jerusalem. From the salty water of the Dead Sea to the surreal desert landscapes of the Negev. Along the way, I meet some of the people that live here, and taste some of the local food. 

I’ll do so from a traveler’s perspective, focusing on the positive stories and things to do. But here and there I also mention the conflict between Israel and Palestine, since it has impacted the lives of many people in the region. For those interested in the politics and modern history of the region, however, I recommend to read, watch, and listen to as many different sources as you can. 

This is my first long trip after the pandemic started, and I’m grateful for the chance to travel again. It’s also my second visit to the region, and therefore I use both new and older footage for this video.

Here’s a brief overview of the content in this video:

We begin this journey in Tel Aviv, Israel’s ‘beach city’. But it’s much more than that, it’s also an economic powerhouse and vibrant cultural center, known for its liberal and cosmopolitan attitude. The next stop is Caesarea, an interesting place for people who are interested in history. This ancient port city was an important place during Roman times, and was only recently excavated by archaeologists. Not far from here is Haifa, known particularly for its beautiful Bahai’s gardens. 

I continue my travels in Akko, a stunning fortified city on the Mediterranean coast. Its winding alleys are a joy to get lost in, and it’s also worth discovering the underground tunnels. Driving onwards, I travel to the Golan Heights, an area popular for outdoor activities, with beautiful mountain landscapes and national parks. It’s also a contested place, as the Golan was captured by Israel from Syria, after Six Day War. As you travel in this region, you come across many reminders of the war. 

Nazareth is one of Christianity’s holiest places, and the place where Jesus is said to have lived for many years. The Basilica of the Annunciation is the absolute highlight for many visitors, and the city is an important place for religious tourism. Also interesting is Nazareth Village, where you can imagine life during the time of Jesus. 

Few places evoke so much imagination as Jerusalem, one of the world’s oldest cities, and holy to Jews, Muslims, and Christians. Walking (into) the Old City can be a magical experience, and to many visitors feels like entering a different world, and era. While Jerusalem is a spiritual and historic center, it’s also a dynamic city, where traditional lifestyles blend with cosmopolitan ideas. 

We continue our journey in the Negev, a vast region in the South of Israel, comprising of arid mountains and surreal desert landscapes. Here, I visit a number of beautiful nature reserves, and also briefly visit a kibbutz. At the Southern tip of the Negev is Eilat, a popular holiday destination for Israeli families, but also a good place to go diving or snorkeling, as it’s located on the Red Sea.

I end the trip on the Dead Sea, known for its high salt levels, where people actually stay afloat. The high concentration of minerals is also said to have healing powers for people with certain skin problems. It’s not all good news though, as the Dead Sea’s water levels are receding at immense speed, mostly due to human activity, such as extraction for industrial purposes, and climate change.",Travel Blogs

► SUPPORT - 'Buy us a refill of diesel' - https://www.buymeacoffee.com/lucastjahn

Follow us on our Grand Moroccan Roadtrip! 
From sweeping sand dunes to desolate highways of emptiness, bustling cities, and snow-covered peaks, we explored Morocco from north to south and east to west. Driving more than 10,000 km in eight weeks, our roadtrip included many unforgettable adventures. Watch as we explore remote landscapes, climb high peaks, battle breath-taking dust-topias (double pun, yeah!), and navigate the hectic bustle of Morocco’s major cities. 

Thank you:
A big THANK YOU goes to Saloua Dabhi who helped tremendously with pronouncing Moroccan names. Additionally, we’d like to thank Christina Neumann (https://www.instagram.com/tyn.91) for her insights into correctly identifying many bird species. And, of course, a big thank you to La Sultana (https://www.lasultanahotels.com) for welcoming us to both of their wonderful properties.

Real Talk:
Despite our attempt at keeping our Morocco Travel Documentary as authentic as possible, you are still watching a highlight reel. When editing, we naturally tend to choose the most exciting videos. What you don’t see are the hours spent driving through less spectacular landscapes or some of the unpleasant challenges we faced. 

Did we like everything about Morocco? 
Far from it. As mentioned in the video, the huge amount of trash definitely dampened our experience. Additionally, we were surprised by the sheer number of begging children. During our trip, we counted a minimum of 500 children asking us for money or sweets. While Morocco undoubtedly has to combat poverty, this behavior often seemed less dictated by need and more by opportunity. Stopping and giving is an individual choice, of course, but when we didn’t we were regularly flipped off, kicked after, or hurled insults at. 
In general, though, we perceived most Moroccans as extremely friendly and helpful. The best example is the three local men who selflessly helped us to change our ruptured tire. We cannot thank them enough.

Full Disclosure:
This trip was entirely self-funded. However, we did enjoy a two-night complimentary stay at La Sultana Oualidia and a two-night complimentary stay at La Sultana Marrakech.

Colombia, a country which many only know because of it’s violent past, has been on my list since I went to South America for my first long-term trip in 2012. 6 Years later and with 5 weeks to spend it was finally time to properly explore my country number 9 on the continent. 

For the first part of the trip I’ll be traveling with my mate David to the historical city of Cartagena, some picturesque Carribean islands and to the city of Medellin where we get to learn about the violent past and the transformation of the country. After a few days in the capital Bogota I’ll be joined by my good friend Stefan to learn salsa and take on some outdoor adventures in Cali before heading up to Santa Marta where we checkout the most beautiful beaches, float down rivers and hike through the mountains.

L-Fzan-VWO0,Journey Through Palestine - Travel Documentary,"Palestine means a lot of different things to many people, and may not be the most obvious travel destination. It is often associated with conflict and political unrest, overlooking the fact that it’s also a beautiful and fascinating region, with a vibrant culture, incredible historic landmarks, spectacular natural scenery, inspiring religious sites, tasty food, and friendly, welcoming people.

On this journey, I’m traveling through the Holy Land, a region important to the three main monotheistic religions, and known today as Israel and Palestine. 

In this first episode, I’m exploring the West Bank, the largest and most accessible part of Palestine. From stunning natural scenery to intriguing historic sites. From the busy streets of Ramallah to the narrow alleyways of Nablus’ old city. From religious landmarks in Hebron and Bethlehem to the ancient ruins of Jericho. Along the way, I meet some of the people that call this land home, and sample the local cuisine. 

I’ll do so from a traveler’s perspective, focusing on the positive stories and things to do. But here and there I also mention the conflict between Israel and Palestine, since it has impacted the lives of many people in the region. For those interested in the politics and modern history of the region, however, I recommend to read, watch, and listen to as many different sources as you can. 

This is my first long trip after the pandemic started, and I’m grateful for the chance to travel again. It’s also my second visit to the region. While much of the footage is from the end of 2021 (including the ‘vlog style’ parts), I’ll also use some background material from 5 years earlier.

Here’s a brief overview of the content in this video:

We start this journey in Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus Christ, with its impressive Church of the Nativity at its core. After visiting the church, I explore the streets around it, meeting people and eating food in the bustling bazaar. There are many other places worth your time in and around Bethlehem, including the Milk Grotto, an olive oil factory (press), Shepherd’s Fields, and the Mar Saba monastery, surrounded by arid mountains. 

Hebron is the next stop, a city in the South of Palestine, and (among other things) famous for its glassblowing factories, and also the Tomb of the Patriarch, or Ibrahimi Mosque. The streets around this place are divided between the local Palestinian community and Israeli settlers. As a tourist, you can visit both areas. At the end of the day, my guide Salwa takes me to a traditional Palestinian restaurant, where we eat some delicious food. 

We continue this trip in Jericho, regarded as the oldest city in the world. Located next to the Dead Sea, it’s also one of the lowest cities on our planet, and can get very hot in Summer. Other sights to visit around Jericho include the Dead Sea, Nabi Musa, Qasr-al-Yahud, and St George’s Monastery, built into a cliff in Wadi Qelt. 

Getting lost in the narrow alleys of Nablus’ old city was among my favorite things to do. There’s a surprise waiting for you around every corner, and perhaps the best one was the Al Aqsa kunafeh store, which is said to make the best version of this Palestinian dessert, which is popular around the Middle East. 

We finish this journey in Ramallah, a young and dynamic city, attracting people from around the region to find work and get educated. It’s a commercial hub with a strong entrepreneurial spirit, and provides a different perspective on this part of Palestine.",Travel Blogs

2xW9mTStyhM,Journey Through Ethiopia - Africa Travel Documentary,"Ethiopia is one of Africa’s most beautiful and fascinating countries, and a surprising travel destination. From spectacular mountain landscapes and national parks to vast lakes and mysterious deserts. From incredible wildlife to intriguing historic landmarks. From vibrant, fast growing cities to small villages and tribal regions, steeped in culture and traditions. 

In this documentary style video, I will show you 10 beautiful places I visited, on a one-month journey through Ethiopia in 2019. I remember the smiles and welcoming attitude of the people, the incredible food, remarkable monuments, the stunning natural and urban landscapes. In all fairness, this was one of my best travels yet. 

Sadly, however, at the time of editing this video, Ethiopia is in political and military conflict with the Northern Tigray region, which is causing great suffering to ordinary civilians. Like most people, I hope the relevant authorities can come to an agreement soon, and start rebuilding this beautiful land. 

As a result of the conflict, some of the places in this video are currently inaccessible due to high security concerns. Always follow travel advice and consult local guides, to avoid putting yourself and others at risk.

Here’s a brief overview of the content in this video:

We start this journey in the small city of Lalibela, a deeply spiritual town popular with Ethiopian Orthodox Christians. The awe-inspiring monolithic churches are the highlight here, but meeting the many pilgrims is equally, if not more, rewarding. After Lalibela, we venture to the mysterious Danakil Depression, one of the hottest and most inhospitable places on Earth. It’s a bizarre desert landscape, with salt lakes, volcanoes, sulfur springs, and acidic pools. It feels like true adventure travel, but can only be done with experienced tour companies and guides. 

The rock-hewn churches of the Tigray region are something unique, and Abuna Yemata Guh may be the most special of them all. This place of worship can only be reached on a steep and sometimes terrifying hike, but rewards travelers with incredible views, and a serene and peaceful atmosphere. The site is managed by several clergymen and priests.

The spectacular Simien mountains offer some of Africa’s best chances for hikes and longer treks, and are also home to the gelada baboons, nicknamed as ‘bleeding heart monkeys’. They live in troops and can live high in the mountains. 

After spending some time in the nature, we continue our journey in Gondar, a friendly city with stunning historic monuments. Perhaps even more impressive is Aksum, with some of Ethiopia’s most iconic historic and religious sites, such as the towering obelisks (or stelea), and the Church of Saint Mary of Zion (which, according to legend, is the hiding place of the Ark of the Covenant, in a small chapel).

Addis Ababa is often overlooked by travelers, who rush themselves to the North and South of the country. But the vibrant capital city is an interesting place to spend a couple of days, and serves as a good introduction to Ethiopian culture and food. There are some great areas to be visited, including the famous Mercato, the largest market in Africa.

After Addis, we travel to the South of Ethiopia, which feels very different in many ways. The first stop here is Arba Minch, known for its wonderful Nechisar national park. Here, you can take boat trips on one of Ethiopia’s largest lakes, and spot crocodiles, pelicans, hippos, baboons and other wildlife. The Dorze village is not far from here, and offers a peak into traditional village life. Its friendly inhabitants have created a sustainable form of tourism, and visitors can witness (and take part in) the local economy at work, with cotton weaving, pottery, coffee ceremonies, bread production, and much more.

We finish this journey in the Omo Valley, which is home to many different ethnicities and tribes. It’s important to travel with local guides here, as these destinations often risk turning into so called ‘human safaris’. While tourism can have a positive effect on people’s lives, it’s crucial that it happens in a respectful and meaningful way.",Travel Blogs

kCNsSeekIAw,"The Wonders of Java - Travel Documentary (Indonesia is not only Bali, Ep. 01)","In this Java Documentary I take you on a road trip across the biggest island of Indonesia with my friends Kiko & Carlotta.
➸ My Indo Travel Planning Kit: https://www.back-packer.org/IndoKit

Java is famous for its many natural sights such as volcanos and waterfalls but it is also the most populous island of the country and with that the historic and cultural center of Indonesia. This Java documentary aims to show the diversity of this island covering the historic and religious background, explaining the cultural roots as well as the culinary variety one can find here besides the natural and man made sights.

All music used in this Indonesia Travel Documentary was provided by Epidemic Sound. Use the following link to get a free 30 day trial (free music for your videos with no obligation to sign up after!):

This Java Travel Documentary is the first part of a Documentary Series called „Indonesia is not only Bali“.  While many visitors mainly focus on Bali alone, Indonesia with its more than 17,000 islands offers a wealth of incredible destinations each with its unique charm and attractions. 

Therefore my plan was to visit a number of different destinations to showcase the diversity of the country to the best of my ability. I’ll be starting my trip off with the largest island, called Java where I’ll be exploring the cities of Jakarta and Yogyakarta to understand the historical and religious background before meeting my friends from Portugal and heading into the nature to see volcanoes, waterfalls and some of the largest jungle temples in the world.

In order to show you the whole diversity of Indonesia we tried to cover the majority of sights in this Java Documentary from the west over the center to the east as well as the volcanos and waterfalls in the center of Java.

You can use this Java Documentary to plan your own trip to Java, on my website you’ll find all essential information needed.

Following I list all places & things to do in Java, Indonesia as seen in this Indonesia Documentary:
- Jakarta
- Yogyakarta
- Borobudur
- Prambanan
- Mt. Merapi
- Cemoro Lawang
- Mt. Bromo
- Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park
- Tumpak Sewu
- Banyuwangi
- Ijen Volcano
- Goa Tetes
- Old Batavia
- Monas 
- King Kong Hill

Full Disclosure:
This trip was supported by Beachcomber Hotels & Resorts as well as the Mauritian Tourism Promotion Agency. As part of our collaboration, we were lucky enough to experience a complimentary stay at all three Beachcomber Resorts, whereas MTPA paid for several of our excursions, i.e. the helicopter flight. All other expenses, i.e. domestic flights, car rental, etc., were paid by ourselves. As usual, all opinions are our own.

0v7cOe1FSUE,Top 10 Places to Visit in Iran - Travel Documentary,"Iran is one of the world’s most beautiful and interesting countries, and an eye-opening travel destination. From mesmerizing desert landscapes to the shores of the Persian Gulf. From the ruins of Persepolis to the modern streets of Tehran. From charming mountain villages to lively historic bazaars. 

Today’s Iran is a complicated, intriguing, but also a fascinating place, with some of the most welcoming and curious people you will ever meet. I traveled through Iran in 2013, and in this video I take you back to 10 favorite places that I visited.

Here’s a brief overview of the content in this video:

We start this journey in Esfahan, one of Iran’s most beautiful and friendliest cities, attracting tourists and travelers from afar. It is filled with captivating monuments, historic buildings, tranquil gardens, museums, and in general provides a great introduction to daily life in Iran. 

After Esfahan, we travel to Kerman, a city on the fringes of the desert. It is most popular for what lies outside the city, the remains of the ‘Arg’ (an ancient citadel), and the small town of Rayen with its beautiful gardens and shrine. Not far from here are the Kaluts, some of Iran’s most spectacular desert scenery. These places are best reached by private vehicle, as public transport here is limited. 

Iran has a long coastline and several island, the largest of which is Qeshm, in the Persian Gulf. This island is relatively underdeveloped and retains much of its traditional characteristics. It’s a great way to get an insight into local Bandari culture, and to witness some of the local economy at work, including agriculture, fishing, and the construction of classic ‘lenge’ boats. 

Shiraz is regarded as the center of Persian culture for the last two millennia, and has some of the country’s most beautiful ancient bazaars and historic mosques. It’s also home for the tombs of Hafez and Sa’di, two poets that hold a special place in Iranian society and literature. The ruins of Persepolis, just outside Shiraz, evoke images of a thriving ancient Persia, and should not be missed. 

The next destination is Tehran, the bustling capital city, and beating economic heart, of Iran. As the most secular and liberal city in the country, it’s the best place to learn about modern Iran. Qom, on the other hand, is one of the conservative ‘strongholds’ in the country, and provides an interesting contrast with Tehran. 

We travel further to Kandovan, a beautiful mountain village where some of the houses are carved out of eroded rocks. It’s near Tabriz, the final destination in the video, famous for its magnificent bazaar.",Travel Blogs

E-t59SPeFaw,Top 10 Places to Visit in Shanghai - China Travel Documentary,"Shanghai is one of the most fascinating cities in China, and in this video I share my personal top 10 places to visit in this amazing city. 

Few cities in the world evoke so much imagination as the largest city in China. Rich and glamorous on one corner, rough around the edges on another, Shanghai is truly one of the most fascinating places in the country. Located in the East of China, Shanghai should be high on any traveler’s list. 

The video starts off on the Bund, a spectacular waterfront promenade located right in the center of the city. It provides a stunning contrast between historic colonial architecture and the awe-inspiring modern skyline of Pudong on the other side of the Huangpu river. Here, you can get some of the best views across the city. After Pudong, I take you to Nanjing street for some shopping, followed by a moment of calm in the rebuilt Jing’An Temple. 

After walking through the People’s (central) park where I encounter a ‘marriage market’, we search for pockets of old Shanghai. These authentic neighborhoods are fast disappearing, as development of apartment towers and shopping malls takes over. 

With enough time, it’s possible to plan a few day trips out of Shanghai. Some of my favorite ones are Suzhou, Zhujiajiao, and the impressive Yangshan Port (Shanghai's main container terminal, or harbor). Back in the city, we travel to the outskirts to visit a ‘bicycle graveyard’ and visit a few trade shows. Probably not your regular 'tourist attraction', but interesting places for those interested in doing business in China. The video finishes at the former Expo site, taking you back to one of the largest events ever held in China.

PAKISTAN'S SURPRISE! | HUNZA VALLEY 🇵🇰

Gilgit Baltistan - Northern Areas of Pakistan 
Beautiful Pakistan: In this vlog we take you to Rakaposhi Nagar Valley and Attabad Lake in Hunza. 
This is Day 4 of our travel in Northern Areas of Pakistan. We started our journey from Khuiratta, Kotli Azad Kashmir and have covered many areas such as Mansehra, Naran, Kaghan, Jal Khand, Babusar Top/Pass, Chilas, Gilgit and Hunza. In this travel vlog, we take you from Gilgit to Rakaposhi and then to Attabad Lake. Our journey along Karakoram Highway led us to see some amazingly beautiful places in Pakistan.

Tourism in Gilgit-Baltistan focuses on the mountains. Gilgit-Baltistan borders Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province to the west, a small portion of the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan to the north, Xinjiang, China to the northeast, the Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to the southeast, and the Pakistani-administered state of Azad Kashmir to the south.

Gilgit-Baltistan is home to five of the ""eight-thousanders"" and to more than fifty peaks above 7,000 metres (23,000 ft). Gilgit and Skardu are the two main hubs for expeditions to those mountains. The region is home to some of the world's highest mountain ranges. The main ranges are the Karakoram and the western Himalayas. The Pamir Mountains are to the north, and the Hindu Kush lies to the west. Amongst the highest mountains are K2 (Mount Godwin-Austen) and Nanga Parbat, the latter being one of the most feared mountains in the world.

Three of the world's longest glaciers outside the polar regions are found in Gilgit-Baltistan: the Biafo Glacier, the Baltoro Glacier, and the Batura Glacier. There are, in addition, several high-altitude lakes in Gilgit-Baltistan.

The Karakoram Highway is the major highway of Gilgit-Baltistan, which connects the region with the rest of Pakistan to the south and with China at its north end. It is highest paved road in world is sometimes termed as the ""8th Wonder of World

Gilgit Baltistan is home of world highest and beautiful valleys. These include Ghancha, Shiger, Astore Valley, Gilgit, Ghizer Valley, Hunza Valley, Skardu and Nagar Valley.

Hunza Valley is considered one of the most beautiful valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan. It consists of Upper Hunza, Central Hunza, and Lower Hunza. Karimabad is the major city of the valley and has all facilities for mountaineers and tourists.[2] The popularity of the Hunza Valley and the amount of tourism there is due in part to its relative accessibility and proximity to the Karakoram Highway.

Major tourist attractions in Hunza are:

Attabad Lake - A major lake of Hunza Valley. It was created following a landslide at Hunza River near Attabad village on 4 January 2010. The resulting damming of the river caused the lake to slowly form, submerging several villages and displacing up to 6,000 people.
Baltit Fort - An old medieval fort located in Karimabad. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
Hussaini Suspension Bridge - A long wooden suspension bridge over Hunza River near Husaaini village. It is sometimes referred locally to as the ""Indiana Jones Bridge"" It is termed as one of the most dangerous bridges in the world.

Khunjerab Pass - At 4,693 meters, this is the highest border crossing in the world. It is also the only modern crossing on the China-Pakistan border. Most tourists visit on a daytrip from Hunza to see the border and then leave. The surrounding area is also a part of the Khunjerab National Park, which was set up to protect local, endangered wildlife, specifically the Marco Polo sheep.

Rakaposhi is a mountain in north of Pakistan in the karakoram mountain range. It is situated in the Nagar valley in Gilgit Baltistan

Attabad lake is also situated in Hunza Nagar. Attabad lake is one of the most beautiful lakes in Pakistan

Dmfm_0oBmeE,Trip through Cyprus - Mediterranean journey | DW Documentary,"As legend would have it, Aphrodite was born here - on Cyprus. The sea on its southern coastline is said to be the font of all love. The island is one of the oldest cradles of civilization in the Mediterranean: The Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, Ottomans and British all lived here at some point in history.

No sooner has our presenter Sineb El Masrar arrived on the island than she sets off for the Troodos mountains, where she tastes some prize-winning Cypriot wine.

Next stop on the journey is Ayia Napa, for a meeting with Louis Hadjioannou. The marine biologist is looking for an intruder that really shouldn’t be here at all: the lionfish. Climate change has lured the creature to the Mediterranean Sea.

Just as in many places throughout the world, the Cypriots set great store by good food and drink. For Roddy Damalis, who owns the restaurant ""TaPiatakia”, the focus is on breathing new life into traditional dishes by combining them with unusual ingredients.
 
After that, the presenter heads for the beach. More than four million tourists visited Cyprus in 2019, often bringing mountains of plastic waste along with them. The environmental protection organization Akti campaigns against the increase and the consequences of plastic waste on beaches - by giving talks in schools, for example. During the summer months, student curriculums also include beach clean-ups. Sineb El Masrar talks to Charis Theodorou about the campaign and the microplastics problem blighting the Mediterranean.

From things in the air, to new things for our bodies, join me as we explore 2050: What Would Be The Future Technology?
We are in the year 2020, and if we're being honest with ourselves, technology is incredible advanced, and we're making strides that can push things even farther. We have cars that are much safer than they've been in the past decade, and we're even making fully electric cars that can help save the planet. There are even plans for self-driving cars and even self-driving Ubers that make the future of transportation very exciting. And that's just ONE technology that we're growing at a fast rate. What about all the others that are out there? What will technology be like as we get closer and closer to 2050?
Let's start with one that well and truly could happen very soon, drones. ""
Let's keep going with transportation, shall we? Right now, one of the biggest ways to get around the countries we live in are trains. Trains ferry people and all sorts of cargo around in an efficient and reliable manner, which is why they've been in use for hundreds of years. But...if we're being honest here, while trains are efficient and reliable in certain ways...they aren't exactly fast. Especially when it comes to passenger and freight trains. They can take a LONG time to get to their destinations and at times it's more logical to take other modes of transportation.
Which is why companies are making special kinds of trains that can go MUCH faster. You know of the magnetic trains of Japan no doubt, but others like the V. Hyperloop are trying to push things even farther. 
""Passengers or cargo are loaded into the hyperloop vehicle and accelerate gradually via electric propulsion through a low-pressure tube. The vehicle floats above the track using magnetic levitation and glides at airline speeds for long distances due to ultra-low aerodynamic drag.""
Science-fiction? Hardly, in fact, the first vehicle of the Hyperloop has already been tested and proven, and some larger tests are being scheduled for the next few years. And if this works, traveling across the country will be MUCH faster. How much faster? The hyperloop aims to send people shooting across the tubes that they make at a rate of about 600 miles per hour.


Ok, we've had some fun ones, but now let's go deeper down the rabbit hole and talk about the ones we all fear...A.I. Yep, artificial intelligence, and no matter what way you look at it, people are seriously trying to make it happen, and make it happen soon. AI's are literally everywhere, including in your cars, and in your homes via devices like Alexa (which are indeed forms of AI), and there are things like Watson that is so smart that it could beat two Jeopardy Legends.

Mars seems to be the place where many feel we can go in order to live amongst the stars. And many speculate that by 2030 at the latest (barring setbacks, accidents, and other things obviously) we could not only be colonizing Mars, but having regular shuttles go there so that people can see the red planet for themselves.
""We will see first people going off to mars, and then robots will do some basic stuff like making basic materials [on Mars,]"" Pearson said. ""We're going to have to do that because only so much can be brought to space.""
Of course, there are numerous things that need to be worked out before such a thing could happen, but we have ""Top Men"" on this, including Elon Musk and the Space X program, Jeff Bezos via his Blue Origin company and more. 
Alright, now let's dive into something REALLY sci-fi...prosthetics. Yeah, I know that RIGHT NOW prosthetics are very limited, and at times...a bit pointless. But IF we were able to fully utilize computer technology to its fullest and make prosthetics that are fully compatible with the human brain and body, then the sky is the limit. We could enter an age where cyborgs are not just welcome, they're commonplace.

Think about it like this, what if the clothes you were wearing right now felt the same, looked the same, but could do more? With the growth of nanotechnology, your clothes could potentially be imbued with various materials or technologies that help you improve your strength, durability, and more.
 virtual reality simulations come through as many expect them to, it could lead to all sorts of innovations in the classrooms that could help kids what's going on.

GCEYnHsmp1I,Is the control of knowledge power? | DW Documentary,"Science, reason and democracy. The Age of Enlightenment began three hundred years ago. It brought greater freedom and progress and paved the way for modern thought. Today, in the 21st century, does the Enlightenment still matter?

The documentary looks deeply at historic Enlightenment thinkers Denis Diderot, Olympe de Gouges, Thomas Jefferson and Immanuel Kant. Then, it puts their ideas to the test in the modern world. 

How much information does humankind need? How can we distinguish between true and false information? How can truth be defended against governments, dictators, and intelligence agencies that spread misinformation and manipulate evidence? And how do we come by real knowledge? 

Norwegian AI expert Anita Schjøll Brede traces these questions from Ghana to London and then back home, in Oslo. She follows in the footsteps of the French Enlightenment philosopher Denis Diderot, who organized the world's knowledge in his life's work, the Encyclopédie. In so doing, he rebelled against the king, the nobility and the church. 

In West Africa, Anita Schjøll Brede takes a road trip with the singer and ""voodoo witch"" Azizaa from Ghana through Togo to Benin, where they attend the world's largest voodoo festival. For Azizaa, voodoo is not a religion, but a lifestyle based on ancient knowledge that has been passed down from generation to generation.

Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom also reflects on the dangers and opportunities of artificial superintelligence. What happens when humans are no longer the most intelligent beings on the planet? What will it mean to be human, then?

5O7P2fEMCI4,Cyborgs: Pushing the Boundaries of &#39;Human&#39; | Science &amp; Technology Documentary,"In just a few years, technology will merge with our bodies in unimaginable ways and push the boundaries of what it is to be human. While medical technology still aims at remediating disabilities, cyborgs strive to something else: a merging of man and machine with the goal of enhancing human capabilities.

The first cyborgs are already crossing the boundaries of their human limits just for the sake of it – at home, in basement workshops and tattoo parlours, using low-tech equipment and a do-it-yourself attitude. They are a tiny minority, seen by many as weird or crazy experimenters, but in the near future we may call them pioneers.

In this film, we meet some of these explorers. We also look at research in medical technology to assess how close science is to creating cyborgs, and ponder the social and ethical dilemmas of a cyborg society.

ExfLBIZwRpo,How private companies are aiming for the stars | DW Documentary,"Billionaires are setting their sights on outer space. Elon Musk, Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos are all sending rockets, people and technology to the stars. Other entrepreneurs around the world also want to join this new contest. Who’ll win the race?

China is also jostling for dominance in space. And when NASA ended rocket launches for financial reasons in 2011, this cleared the way for private companies to compete over a huge future business sector that includes space tourism, satellite operations and raw material extraction. Companies such as Space X, Blue Origin, Axiom Space and many more have already staked their claim to this highly lucrative space market.

More than 50 years after the moon landings, entrepreneurial spirit and scientific progress have rekindled humankind’s dream of conquering space. An extraterrestrial design hotel is already in the planning phase; space raw material mining trials are underway. But state-sponsored space exploration is still indispensable.

The science documentary ""New Space Race"" gained exclusive access to the German Aerospace Center’s Moon-analog mission ""ARCHES"" on Mount Etna in Sicily. Using the landscape here as a substitute for the Moon, research teams run trials for crewed missions to space using robots. It’s already clear that if humans are going to land on other planets one day, the success of scientific endeavors such as this one is crucial. Also clear: The new space race has begun.

5guiUrgcblM,The Danger of AI | Scary Technology | Artificial Intelligence | Documentary,"The Danger of AI - An examination of an alternative means to accurately poll for political opinions through an artificial intelligence program named Polly.

The Danger of AI (2020)
Director: Peter Gombos
Writers: Peter Gombos
Stars: Terez Land
Genre: Documentary
Country: Canada
Language: English
Also Known As: Margin of Error
Release Date: October 17, 2020 (Canada)

Synopsis:
In the face of a century of traditional polling to predict public opinion, there is a shakeup afoot in the prediction game. Margin of Error: AI, Polling and Elections examines how a startup called Advanced Symbolics (ASI) uses artificial intelligence (AI) and public social-media data to forecast voter behaviour. But the promise of new technology also comes with questions about its accuracy, the threat to citizens’ privacy and our democracy itself.

Every one of us volunteers a huge amount of private data with virtually every Internet service we use, without reading or understanding the terms of service. This data can now be harvested by AI to accurately predict among many other things, how we will vote.

Even without surrendering personal information, the new AI algorithm Polly, developed by ASI, combs social media to build profiles of different demographics and determines their preferences.This method has already led to Polly’s success in predicting both the 2016 Trump victory and Brexit. With the 2019 Canadian federal election campaign as a real time back drop, Margin of Error puts Polly to the test revealing how an AI doesn’t just give a detailed picture of the publics voting intentions, but also how specific events can alter them.

But will knowing what our hopes and concerns are, give politicians the intel they need to respond to our needs, and lead to a “utopian” society, as ASI’s CEO Erin Kelly claims, or can this data be misused to mislead us – either by our own governments, or those of our adversaries? And should politicians even be responding to our desires, as expressed through social media?

2077 - 10 Seconds to the Future | Global Estrangement: https://youtu.be/CTOduDIkcdM

We are at the starting line of an exponential technological change. In the coming decades we will experience the dematerialization of technology. Computers will abandon desks to be installed in eyes, in walls and in everything that surrounds us. Chips will be integrated in virtually everything around us, transmitting vital information. The quality of life and the average life expectancy will increase astoundingly, and aging will be delayed. We will have the capacity to choose genes for our children and to create new forms of life. In 2007, a smartphone had more power than the computers NASA used to take man to the moon in 1969. In 2077 it’s likely that we will control the objects around us through our thought. The opinion that the revolution under way is the biggest and fastest ever is unanimous, with the interception of genetics, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence. The consequences are many and cross-cutting, with great impact on our health. However, the rise of the machine raises unprecedented challenges, even the possibility of the extinction of Humankind itself.

s0dMTAQM4cw,Artificial intelligence and algorithms: pros and cons | DW Documentary (AI documentary),"Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are leading to fundamental changes in the way we live. Algorithms can already detect Parkinson's disease and cancer, and control both cars and aircraft. How will AI change our society in the future?

This documentary journeys to the hot spots of AI research in Europe, the USA and China, and looks at the revolutionary developments which are currently taking place. The rapid growth of AI offers many opportunities, but also many dangers. AI can be used to create sound and video recordings which will make it more and more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. It will make the world of work more efficient and many professions superfluous. Algorithms can decide whether to grant loans, who is an insurance risk, and how good employees are. But there is a huge problem: humans can no longer comprehend how algorithms arrive at their decisions. And another big problem is AI’s capacity for widespread surveillance. The Chinese city of Rongcheng is already using an AI-supported 'social credit system' to monitor and assess its citizens. Does AI pose a danger to our personal freedoms or democracy? Which decisions can we leave to the algorithms - and which do we want to? And what are AI’s social implications?

Today no one doubts this is true but in Boltzmann's day it was a controversial idea and many of his contemporaries disagreed with him. But Boltzmann used brilliant mathematical arguments to show that many aspects of the world we observe, like the behaviour of heat, can be explained if one accepts that atoms are real.

K0m4xAfTVwM,Mysteries of Lightning - Secrets Revealed - Full Documentary,"Scientists find clues to the mystery of what causes lightning - It's well-known that lightning is an electric current—a quick, powerful burst of charge that flows within a cloud or between a cloud and the ground. But surprisingly, scientists still don't fully understand how the initial spark forms that generates such powerful lightning. In a new paper published in Nature Communications, researchers from Langmuir Laboratory at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology near Socorro, New Mexico, have reported observations of a rare but extremely powerful type of lightning spark, or discharge, called narrow bipolar events. The scientists found that this powerful type of lightning is caused by a newly recognized type of discharge called fast positive breakdown, and the data suggests that this same discharge initiates most or even all of the lightning flashes typically seen in thunderstorms. These sparks travel at speeds that are fast even for lightning—around 10 to 100 million meters per second—and produce very powerful radiofrequency (RF) radiation as high as a few megawatts, making them the strongest natural sources of RF radiation on Earth.

This discovery is surprising, since previous simulations have shown that lightning breakdown appears to be negative, meaning the spark moves upward in the cloud from a negative to a positive region. In positive breakdown, the spark moves downward from a positive to a negative region.

""It is impossible to simulate thunderstorm conditions in a conventional laboratory,"" coauthor William Rison at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology told Phys.org. ""The sparks in thunderstorms are hundreds of meters to kilometers long, a scale that is orders of magnitude larger than in any laboratory environment. Theorists have been trying to simulate these conditions in computer experiments, and the most plausible results have suggested that the sparks are initiated with relativistic electron avalanches, which is a type of negative breakdown. Our results clearly show that the initiation is with a positive breakdown, not a negative breakdown.""

The results could help scientists better understand how a cloud can generate a current that is powerful enough to cause lightning. Currently, the largest electric fields that have been measured inside thunderstorms are several times weaker than what is needed to break down cloudy air and initiate lightning.

In general, lightning occurs when the positive and negative electric charges in a cloud separate in different parts of the cloud. Charge separation sets the stage for lightning to form either between the negative and positive parts of the cloud (intracloud lightning), or downward to the ground (cloud-to-ground lightning), where it often strikes a tree, telephone pole, or other tall object.

Over the past few decades, researchers have gained a better understanding of how the charges become separated in thunderclouds. Data and simulations show that charge separation occurs when small hail-like particles called ""graupel"" and ice crystals collide with one another in a cloud. The charges are separated as the heavier graupel particles fall, while the lighter ice crystals are carried upward by updrafts in the turbulent thundercloud. This process is somewhat like how rubbing your feet on carpet separates charges in your body, causing you to produce static electricity when you touch a metal doorknob.

Since the 1990s, one of the leading proposals for lightning formation is that the initial spark comes from relativistic electrons that come from either high-energy cosmic rays or a process called relativistic runaway electron avalanche. However, the new results cast doubt on this idea.

""If relativistic electron showers were the initiating events for lightning flashes, then the motion of the breakdown would be initially upward for intracloud flashes between the mid-level negative and upper positive charges,"" Rison explained. ""Using a recently developed broadband interferometer to observe the propagation of electrical breakdown in lightning, we found that the propagation direction of narrow bipolar events is downward rather than upward, showing they are caused by downward-developing positive rather than upward-developing negative breakdown.""

Both negative breakdown and positive breakdown can move charges, which can intensify the fields at both ends of the cloud. But the data here shows that all flashes for which the interferometer could determine the motion exhibited an initial breakdown that was fast and positive.

The next step is to investigate how fast positive breakdown develops physically. Fast positive streamers have been observed in sprites, a type of electrical breakdown that occurs in the upper atmosphere where the pressure is several orders of magnitude lower than in thunderclouds. The discharge observed here move at the same fast propagation speeds but at lower altitudes and higher pressures.",Science and Technology

NyfNxspBfsc,Why Does Quantum Entanglement Defy All Logic? | Secrets Of Quantum Physics | Progress,"Professor Jim Al-Khalili traces the story of arguably the most important, accurate and yet perplexing scientific theory ever: quantum physics.

The story of quantum physics starts at the beginning of the 20th century with scientists trying to better understand how light bulbs work. This simple question soon led scientists deep into the hidden workings of matter, into the sub-atomic building blocks of the world around us.  Here they discovered phenomena unlike any encountered before - a realm where things can be in many places at once, where chance and probability call the shots and where reality appears to only truly exist when we observe it.

Albert Einstein hated the idea that nature, at its most fundamental level, is governed by chance. Jim reveals how in the 1930's, Einstein thought he'd found a fatal flaw in quantum physics. This was not taken seriously until it was tested in the 1960s. Professor Al-Khalili repeats this critical experiment, posing the question does reality really exist, or do we conjure it into existence by the act of observation?

Elsewhere, we explore how the most famous law of quantum physics – The Uncertainty Principle – is obeyed by plants and trees as they capture sunlight during the vital process of photosynthesis. Could quantum mechanics explain the greatest mystery in biology - evolution?

Welcome to Progress -- the home of history's greatest leaps forward. From the seismic invention of the world's first printing press to the great rocket-powered marvels that took us to the stars, we'll be bringing you world-class documentaries celebrating history's greatest inventions and technological breakthroughs.

8kfAdgCTF9k,How humans are exploiting the oceans | DW Documentary,"What would be the consequences of industrial exploitation of the ocean floor? A deep-sea expedition in the Pacific explores this question. Raw materials have been mined on land for thousands of years, often with negative consequences for nature and people.

Deep down in the ocean, valuable raw materials are stored en masse: manganese, nickel, cobalt, copper. Many of these materials are currently in great demand. Technically, it is possible to harvest manganese nodules, for example, in the deep sea. But should we do it? Even among the researchers aboard the ""Island Pride,"" opinions differ. They are part of a deep-sea expedition to research the possible effects of harvesting raw materials on the ocean floor. What will be the consequences if humans exploit these valuable deposits? Will it destroy the fragile underwater environment? 
Reporter Michael Stocks and his cameraman spent weeks aboard the ship, on which scientists are monitoring the deployment of a giant underwater harvesting machine on the ocean floor. Humans are dredging the sand from beaches, overfishing fish stocks worldwide - is the seabed now to be industrially exploited as well?

NG2Y_GpNCds,"PLATINUM Documentary: Mining, Science and History","In this platinum documentary, we explore platinum mining, science, history, and the future outlook for this truly unique commodity.

As one of the lesser known, but nonetheless vital precious metals, platinum has a long history of being used for jewelry and ornamentation, reaching back to the ancient Egyptian empire, having been discovered on a coffin unearthed in Thebes, estimated to be from the 7th century BC.

Modern day uses of platinum include being a key element in catalytic converters for vehicles , as a catalyst in the chemical industry, and even in the creation of life-saving anti-cancer drugs.

In this platinum documentary, we explore this exclusive metal that befuddled miners and scientists alike when it was first discovered. Dubbed ‘platina’ or ‘little silver’ by the Spanish Conquistadors, the truth is, platinum is so much more than meets the eye.

tRRoYeKztbY,Superfoods – is healthy eating just hype? | DW Documentary,"Are superfoods all that they’re cracked up to be? There’s plenty of worldwide hype about eating chia seeds, goji berries and quinoa - but what benefits do they really bring?

This documentary looks at what superfoods do for people and more. How is the healthy eating boom influencing agriculture and business? There are more and more restaurants serving superfoods in Germany. Florian Klar of Bochum opened the first superfood bistro in the Ruhr region about a year ago. He buys in all types of food, using local suppliers when he can, but he also uses exotic superfoods in his meals. 

Quinoa, goji berries and chia seeds can now all be found in supermarkets as well. The food industry has discovered selling these products is lucrative and changed its product selection accordingly. Superfoods are simply that a foodstuff contains a high amount of nutrients. ""Every country has its own superfood,” says nutritionist Matthias Riedl. Blueberries, flax seed, blackcurrants, and kale are all superfoods native to Germany. 

The film also takes viewers to Bolivia, a key quinoa exporter, to see how the hype has influenced farming there. Exports of the so-called ""Inca corn” quadrupled between 2007 and 2013. The rising price of quinoa on global markets has led Andean farmers to increase the size of their fields. Yet after just two straight years of quinoa harvests, the soil is already exhausted and barren.

Episode 2 - How Food Affects Our Mental Health: https://youtu.be/Wth5CSX7_hQ
Episode 3 - Why Poor Sleep Leads to Weight Gain: https://youtu.be/C_DFBqJKZZE

It's official: There are now more fat people than skinny people in the world. Obesity is the most significant health crisis on the planet. For the first time in history, children are facing shorter lives than their parents.

Over the last 35 years, obesity rates have more than doubled, leading to a massive and rapid increase in heart disease, kidney problems, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes. How did we go from obesity rates of 9% to 30% in less than a generation?

Presented by overweight and diabetic Chef Simon Gault, this documentary examines the science behind a re-examination of traditionally accepted health advice and the emergence of new evidence that makes sense of the looming health problems we face. Gault talks to experts from around the world and allows himself to be a human guinea pig to improve his own health.

5RwIWGkMxrE,How Corporations Are Ruining Your Health (Food Industry Documentary) | Real Stories,"When we walk into a supermarket, we assume that we have the widest possible choice of healthy foods. But in fact, over the course of the 20th century, our food system was co-opted by corporate forces whose interests do not lie in providing the public with fresh, healthy, sustainably-produced food.

Fortunately for America, an alternative emerged from the counter-culture of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where a group of political anti-corporate protesters–led by Alice Waters–voiced their dissent by creating a food chain outside of the conventional system. The unintended result was the birth of a vital local-sustainable-organic food movement which has brought back taste and variety to our tables.

FOOD FIGHT is a fascinating look at how American agricultural policy and food culture developed in the 20th century, and how the California food movement has created a counter-revolution against big agribusiness.

So why are they using tactics banned in the West in the developing world? There, they have created ultra low cost products with higher levels of salt, sugar and saturated fats.

Tackling one of the greatest health catastrophes of our time, this powerful film reveals how what we eat exacerbates illnesses and, more importantly, explains — in an accessible and engrossing manner — how we can prevent, arrest and even reverse chronic diseases through diet. Along with professional insights from several leading physicians and medical researchers, Eating You Alive features compelling endorsements from celebrities such as director James Cameron and actress Suzy Amis Cameron, actor Samuel L. Jackson and entertainer Penn Jillette, in addition to moving testimonies from everyday individuals who have healed themselves with whole foods. It's time for a revolution in healthcare and it starts with the next bite.

52:25 The food system is financialised
54:28 What are the solutions?

This lecture was filmed at the Ri on 19 September 2023 through the generous support of Digital Science.

The industrialisation and commercialisation of food have transformed our diets, whereby most of our calories now come from an entirely novel set of substances. Ultra Processed Food (UPF) now makes up 60% of the average diet in the UK and USA. It is highly processed, highly addictive, and largely unhealthy.

Join award-winning broadcaster, practising NHS doctor and leading academic Chris van Tulleken as he explores the invention of UPF and its impact on our health and weight – from altering metabolism and appetite to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and tooth decay.

Chris uncovers the limitations of relying solely on exercise and willpower to combat the health risks of high UPF diets. Drawing on his own experiment of eating an 80% UPF diet for one month he provides solutions for both individuals and policymakers to challenge this unregulated industry.

Chris van Tulleken is an infectious diseases doctor at UCLH and one of the UK’s leading science broadcasters. He has won two BAFTAs for his long-running CBBC series Operation Ouch, co-presented with his twin brother Xand, and hosted numerous programmes across the BBC. Following his BBC One documentary ‘What Are We Feeding Our Kids?’ and the chart-topping podcast ‘A Thorough Examination – Addicted to Food’, Chris has become the UK’s go-to expert on ultra-processed food.

Chris trained at Oxford and has a PhD in molecular virology from University College London, where he is now an Associate Professor. His research focuses on how corporations affect human health, especially in the context of nutrition.

myv7yydtCKc,"Junk food, sugar and additives - The dark side of the food industry | DW Documentary","40% of the global population is overweight or obese. Highly processed industrial foodstuffs are largely to blame. But food companies continue to focus on products that are addictive.

Sugar is one of the strongest ""drugs” and can get consumers really hooked. Food giants know this only too well. That’s why they use sugar, fats and flavor enhancers to encourage people to buy their products and boost their profits. The result: more and more people around the world are overweight or obese. Illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are becoming more prevalent. What can be done to change or even put a stop to the food industry’s strategies?

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe)

Chris van Tulleken is a doctor and TV presenter who says most of the food that we eat isn’t really food. “Whether you're eating a burger, or a piece of fried chicken, or a breakfast cereal, there are illusions of texture. There will be little crunches and pops and snaps and greasy bits and dry bits and chewy bits. But it's all inhalably fast-to-eat and the hormones that tell you to stop just can't keep up.”

His latest book, ‘Ultra-Processed People’, explores how ultra-processed food is designed to fuel addiction and is creating an epidemic of diet-related disease. 

Today, Chris joins Krishnan Guru-Murthy on Ways to Change the World to discuss the dangers of a UPF diet, and why urgent government regulation is needed.

RESTART your life in 7 days: https://bit.ly/3PmRcok

On Today's Episode:

If you’re following government guidelines for food and health, watch this episode very carefully, as the industry and policy lies being exposed are triggering.

Calley Means has been advising politicians and prominent food and pharma companies and has founded his own  company, TrueMed, to expose and change the food industries causing harm that the healthcare industry is profiting heavily.

The best thing for you to do right now is get as educated about the system you are part of as citizens, consumers, and patients of all parties involved in feeding yourself and your families. This conversation hits hard when you realize how inescapable all of this feels.

Calley shares from experience working with big food industries and losing his mother to a succession of foodborne illnesses that have everything to do with food that’s leading to cancer, Alzheimers, heart disease, obesity, autoimmune conditions,and depression.

Thoughts that exposes areas you can start rethinking and changing right away:

$10 billion dollars is transferred in a year from the government to soda companies through food-stamps, part of a nutrition program designed to to help low income families.
Lower income men die 11 years younger than higher income men, largely because of diet
Healthcare, big pharma, food companies, and public policy makers make the solution for metabolic health sound extremely complicated, but it’s really not complicated,it’s just not beneficial for them.

You and everyone around you is being sickened by preventable metabolic dysfunction. Now is the time to get educated and manage your risk and the risks to your family and the environment we live in. This may be the best place to start your research to take action on not being poisoned and blinded by the food and healthcare industry lies. Consuming ultra-processed foods, seed oils, copious amounts of sugar and highly processed grains is not in your best interest. 

Food and lifestyle interventions are some of the most effective ways to prevent and heal diseases like Alzheimers, depression, and diabetes. What will you change today to make eating healthy the default for you, your children, and your family?

Calley Means Quotes:

“Cancer, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, obesity, autoimmune conditions, these are all going up and they are all foodborne illnesses, and the fact that there is not clear communication about that from our medical leaders and public policy leaders, I think is the biggest scandal in America and the most dangerous scandal.”

“Today when you hear about the opioid crisis, 80-90% of people that overdose and die from illicit opioids, that started with a prescription pad.”

“Prediabetes is violence occurring to their cells, a child born today has a 45% rate of obesity or being overweight, [...] 40% of 18 year olds right now qualify as having a mental illness.”

“We need to stop recommending poison and stop subsidizing poison and the free market will figure it out.”

“95% of the experts on the USDA nutrition guidelines committee receive personal payments from food and or pharma companies.”

“Americans listen to medical leaders, [...] for better or worse we listen to medical leaders.”

“There’s express lobbying from processed food companies to keep the SNAP contributions low so people can only afford processed food.”

About the series: 
A Bite of China (Chinese: 舌尖上的中国; pinyin: Shéjiān shàng de Zhōngguó; literally: ""China on the tongue tip"") is a Chinese documentary television series on the history of food, eating, and cooking in China directed by Chen Xiaoqing (陈晓卿), narrated by Li Lihong (李立宏) with original music composed by Roc Chen (阿鲲). It first aired May 14, 2012 on China Central Television and quickly gained high ratings and widespread popularity. The seven-episode documentary series, which began filming in March 2011, introduces the history and story behind foods of various kinds in more than 60 locations in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The documentary has also been actively encouraged as a means of introducing Chinese food culture to those unfamiliar with local cuisine. Various notable chefs such as Shen Hongfei and Chua Lam were consultants on the project.

A second season of A Bite of China, also consisting of seven episodes (plus trailer), aired from April 18 to June 6, 2014.

About episode The Taste of Time (时间的味道):
This episode focuses on the different preservation techniques and preserved food across the regions.Time is a friend of food, and also its enemy. New technologies can help preserve food, while traditional preservative techniques may create different and even tenderer flavours through salting, air-drying, stewing or smoking procedures. Today, the renovated traditional foods still influence the Chinese diet and preserve the unique feeling of the Chinese towards flavour and the world.",Food

Watch 'Opioid Tragedy: Inside the Fentanyl Crisis' here: https://youtu.be/Dfv_tISYl8A

Kenny Saylors, after years of being healthy and athletic, became severely overweight and after trying various diets decided to do something drastic about it. With the support of his Doctor, he decided to stop eating for 55 days, drinking only water.

Facing the Fat documents his journey, from the realisation that he had a physical and mental addiction to the chemicals in junk food, to the detox and repair that his body goes through during this record-breaking fast. It also looks at the wider implications of over-eating for the individual, society and the world at large.

Obesity has become one of the most overwhelming diseases in modern society costing American taxpayers $99 billion every year, while the number of overweight people has surpassed the number of people suffering from malnutrition by 200 million.

Facing the Fat presents an entertaining and inspiring challenge but also makes the serious point, that obesity is not just a personal struggle, but one that has far reaching implications for us all.

uMv2TZUSPdg,"What is &quot;Ultra Processed&quot; Food, and Why Does It Lead to Weight Gain?","Ultra-processed foods have become ubiquitous in modern diets. Many of us eat them regularly without understanding their potential impacts on our health. 

From hidden additives to addictive properties, these highly processed foods can pose risks. 

Navigating the complex world of ultra-processing can be challenging, and many people struggle to understand what to avoid, how to break unhealthy habits, and make positive changes to their health.

In today’s episode, Jonathan is joined by a special guest, Dr. Chris van Tulleken, to explore the science behind ultra-processed food.

Dr. Chris van Tulleken is an infectious diseases doctor at University College Hospital, in London, and one of the BBC’s leading science presenters. 

Chris shares the groundbreaking research from his own lived experiments, including the now famous study with his twin brother Xand. His book Ultra-Processed People is out now.

Jonathan and Chris are joined by ZOE regular Tim Spector. Drawing from their combined expertise, our guests provide practical tips and advice, empowering listeners to make informed choices and take control of their diets.

iVJM_0XEiBI,FAT: A Documentary - Health and Wellness Documentary,"FAT tells the far-fetched but completely true history of how our country became so unhealthy. In 1970, just over 1.5 million people had been diagnosed with Diabetes in the United States. Now over 30 million have Diabetes. What's even more alarming is that 100 million people, 1 in 3, have Diabetes or are Pre-Diabetic. This is not to mention the 40% of the population that is obese. How is this possible with the non-stop flow of new diets, exercise machines and our general obsession with health and weight loss? We're as unhealthy as ever. The truth is that we have pretty much had everything completely upside-down and backward. FAT traces a detailed history spanning 150 years to show how misinformation and outright lies have become ""truth.""

zDeZ4cZ3Oi4,Will Eating Right Save This Man From Dying? | The Food Hospital | Documentary Central,"The Food Hospital doctors meet Karen and her 6 year old son, Callum, whose lives are both blighted by psoriasis. Karen fears her son will get bullied like she has been because his lesions are so noticeable. No amount of creams and potions seem to help, so Karen and Callum are turning to food after conventional medicine has failed. Professional singer Sophie suffers from such severe acid reflux that, if it continues, could spell the end of her career. 

After 13 years of this condition, she is also at risk of Barrett’s Oesophagus, which can increase the risk of cancer. Sixteen-year-old Rianna is looking for an answer to her distressing and unexplained hair loss. And can obese 38-year-old father Ian reverse his dangerously fatty liver through food and increase his life expectancy? Dr Pixie McKenna investigates the truth about vitamin supplements, asking if they have any real benefit to our health.

The film traces the origins of our beliefs about healthful and unhealthful food. Experts from all over the world talk about the problems as well as short and long term solutions. Among the many experts in the film are authors like Gary Taubes, Mark Sisson, and Melanie Warner. Medical doctors such as David Perlmutter M.D., David L. Katz, and Timothy Noakes share insights that are certain to challenge the status quo.

Carb-Loaded: A Culture Dying to Eat is a chronicle of the things it's writer and director Lathe Poland learned after he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. He sought to find out why he got sick, because he didn't fit the classic picture of an adult onset diabetes sufferer. He quickly learned that much of what he knew about healthy eating was based on myths or fifty year old science. In the film he searches out why Americas modern food culture is killing us. The upside? There is a lot that can be done!

K3ksKkCOgTw,The Secrets of Sugar - the fifth estate,"We’ve heard for years about the dangers of eating too much fat or salt. But there have never been recommended limits for sugar on Canadian food labels, despite emerging research that suggests the sweet stuff may be making more of us fat and sick. In the fifth estate’s season premiere, Gillian Findlay digs into the surprising science — and the reaction from the food industry — to reveal The Secrets of Sugar. Has the sugar industry been hiding an unsavoury truth from consumers?

A small but influential group of medical researchers is stirring up the health debate, linking sugar not just to rising obesity rates but also to a host of diseases including cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer’s.

We put a family of four on a healthy diet to try to beat their sugar habit and track the surprising results. We talk to leading scientists – and their critics. And we ask the food industry why those ingredient labels are far from clear when it comes to how much sugar is really on your plate.

CUdeCHmWNf0,Corrupt Food Industry | Lobbying Against Health | Meat Consumption | Documentary,"Corrupt Food Industry - How come ham is pink? Why do we believe that it is good for our children? Why are product labels beyond understanding? Industrial giants are able to stall and orientate policy decisions that directly affect public health.

Corrupt Food Industry (2016)
Director: Guillaume Coudray, Sandrine Rigaud
Writers: Guillaume Coudray, Sandrine Rigaud
Genre: Documentary
Country: France
Language: English
Also Known As: Cash Investigation: The Meat Lobby: Big Business Against Health?
Release Date: December 1, 2016 (France)
Filming Location: Paris, France

Synopsis:
In 2015, the WHO listed one of the additives in processed meats as carcinogenic. That same additive was nearly banned in America in the 1970s – until lobbying from the meat industry discredited the scientists. We reveal how, to impede or halt regulations on certain additives, lobbyists have been working in the shadows for decades.

At the heart of this strategy are the scientists who collaborate, who receive generous compensation for studies that promote meat consumption. In conjunction with this, those whose work finds health risks associated with meat are ‘shot down’.

bm-6_0xiQNc,"USA&#39;s Obesity Epidemic: Heart Attack Grills, Fat Camps and Plus-Size Beauty Pageants | Documentary","Never in all its history has America been so obese. With 160 million Americans severely overweight, in this documentary explore increasingly aggressive treatments as well as the counter-trend of body positivity and 'Miss Plus' beauty pageants.

Despite repeated government efforts to encourage the population to slim down, the obesity rates just keep climbing. 

Faced with this staggering figure, healthcare professionals are trying to find new, more efficient and more aggressive treatments for this illness… We meet Casey, one of the few people whose weight has become a matter of life and death, and travel to Arizona to see an innovative new academy helping young girls learn healthy habits and slim down.

Despite the rising obesity crisis, a new movement is shaking up the United States: body positivity. Through lucrative social media accounts, popular magazine covers and even successful ‘Miss Plus’ beauty pageants, overweight Americans are learning to flaunt their curves and love themselves no matter their size.

4QfCIUdW6JE,The Raw Food Diet | Am I Perfect | FULL DOCUMENTARY | Origin,"Would you eat raw food to lose weight?

Am I Perfect? follows the journey of Madeleine Humphreys, as she sets out on an all-consuming quest in an attempt to obtain Hollywood ‘perfection’.

In this self transforming exploration, Madeleine pushes herself to the limits over ten weeks to see if she can achieve ‘Hollywood’ perfection. In a star studded world of crazed pop culture, social media domination and celebrity fixation, where appearance infatuation has become an obsession, it is not surprising that body image has become a top concern. The media affects our ideas of who we are and who we could be, so much so that looking at fashion magazines for just three minutes lowers the self-esteem of over 80% of women.

BVvnSzMqI3M,How LUXURY Rolls-Royce Cars Are Made ? (Mega Factories Video),"Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is a British luxury automobile maker. A wholly owned subsidiary of German group BMW, it was established in 1998 after BMW was licensed the rights to the Rolls-Royce brand name and logo from Rolls-Royce plc and acquired the rights to the Spirit of Ecstasy and Rolls-Royce grill shape trademarks from Volkswagen AG. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited operates from purpose-built administrative and production facilities opened in 2003 across from the historic Goodwood Circuit in Goodwood, West Sussex, England, United Kingdom. Rolls-Royce Motors Cars Limited is the exclusive manufacturer of Rolls-Royce branded motor cars since 2003.

Although the Rolls-Royce brand has been in use since 1906, the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary of BMW AG has no direct relationship to Rolls-Royce-branded vehicles produced prior to 2003 other than being a major engine and other supplier prior to 2003. The Bentley Motors Limited subsidiary of Volkswagen AG is the direct successor to Rolls-Royce Motors and various other predecessor entities that produced Rolls-Royce and Bentley branded cars between the foundation of each company and 2003, when the BMW-controlled entity started producing cars under the Rolls-Royce brand

The Hyundai Creta, also known as Hyundai ix25 in China, is an automobile produced by Hyundai since 2014 mainly for emerging markets, particularly BRICS. A subcompact crossover SUV, it is positioned below the Tucson in Hyundai's SUV line-up.

The first-generation model debuted as a near-production concept car in China in April 2014, while the second generation was first introduced in 2019. The second-generation model was also available in a longer derivative with three-row seating, which is known as the Hyundai Alcazar, Creta Grand or Grand Creta. The vehicle has been manufactured in China, India, Russia, Brazil, and Indonesia. For developed markets like South Korea, the United States, Canada, EU/EFTA/EEA countries (with the exception of the French overseas collectivities of French Polynesia and New Caledonia) and Australia, the Creta is not offered in favour of the smaller but more advanced Kona.

The model was named after the Crete island in Greece. The name is also intended to suggest connections with ""creative"". In the Dominican Republic, it is sold as the Hyundai Cantus.

The Creta has been the best-selling SUV in Russia since 2017. It is also the highest-selling SUV in India since 2020, and the third best-selling Hyundai model globally since 2019

The Creta went on sale in India on 21 July 2015, produced at the Chennai plant. At launch, the Creta is available in a choice of three engines — a 1.6-litre petrol, a 1.4 or a 1.6-litre diesel from the Verna. A 6-speed manual transmission will be standard across all variants, with only the 1.6 diesel SX+ variant getting the option of a 6-speed automatic. The engine options was spread to six trim levels, which are Base, S, S+, SX, SX+ and the top-spec SX (O).

The Creta SX is also offered with a dual tone red and black or a white and black exterior color options. The SX dual tone variant is powered by a 1.6-liter gasoline or a diesel engine without any automatic transmission option.

For select trims, the Creta is equipped including Vehicle Stability Management (VSM), Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Hillstart Assist Control (HAC), Rear Parking Assist System, and ABS. The six airbag system provides all round protection. One for the driver, one for the front seat passenger, front and rear curtain airbags running the length of the cabin, plus front side airbags. Hyundai also claimed the vehicle is built with HIVE body structure, which signifies structural strength.

By November 2015, the vehicle has registered over 70,000 bookings in India and 15,770 worldwide.[26] By August 2017, more than 200,000 Creta was sold in the country.

In 2017, the vehicle contains about 90% Indian parts.

Yutzg2NLwcU,Giant Aircraft: Manufacturing an Airbus A350 | Mega Manufacturing | Free Documentary,"Mega Manufacturing: Airbus A350 | 4K Engineering Documentary

Build your own Airbus A350: https://amzn.to/3LVjh2F

World's Most Advanced Supercars: Birth of the Automobile: https://youtu.be/LbD8leFCB-I

Assembled in France using millions of components made throughout Europe: The A350 is the most modern commercial aircraft in the world. 

The Airbus A 350: the most modern commercial aircraft in the world. It takes 1800 highly-skilled specialists in Toulouse, France, and 2.5 million individual parts, delivered from all over the world, to assemble this masterpiece of aeronautic engineering. The goal: An aircraft with minimal consumption and maximum range. 53 percent of the Aircraft consist of a modern ultra-light composite material. But the innovative material also requires entirely new manufacturing processes. A challenge for the aircraft manufacturers in Toulouse. And the final assembly is preceded by a logistical masterpiece: The individual parts of the aircraft travel from various Airbus plants in Europe to Toulouse: the front and centre sections from Saint-Nazaire in France, the tail section from Hamburg, the wings from Broughton in Wales and Bremen, and the tail fin from Getafe in Spain. The factory in Toulouse is supplied with these parts by a specially developed transport aircraft, the Beluga. Several times a day, five of these machines commute between the various plants and bring supplies for production seven days a week from early in the morning until midnight. And the journey of the components is not over in Toulouse. By the time the A350 is fully assembled it will have passed through seven hangars or ""stations."" Given the extremely high number of components that have to be assembled and the large number of different suppliers, there are a lot of risk factors involved in the production of the A350. And the pressure is high: The modern aircraft is extremely popular with airlines, with 890 pending orders to date. Ten aircraft of the A350 have to leave the factory every month no matter what.

SuJGXTFDqj8,Excavator Factory | Mega Manufacturing | Free Documentary,"Mega Manufacturing: Sany Excavator Factory | 4K Engineering Documentary

One of the largest and most modern excavator factories in the world. Every ten minutes, a new high-tech monster rolls off the assembly line in China.

Lingang, China. Home to one of the largest and most modern excavator factory in the world! 1000 square meters of production area, equipped with high-tech machines of the latest generation. By this means China's market leader Sany wants to become the number one in the world! 

For half a billion euros, the construction machinery giant has built the mega factory. Now 1,600 specialists ensure a breathtaking output: theoretically every ten minutes a new excavator can roll off the production line! In order to achieve the enormous number of strokes, the huge production halls are equipped with the latest generation of robots. They process up to 250 tons of steel every day. In some areas the robots have completely taken over the production of the excavators. In the state-of-the-art welding plant, for example, twenty-four workers were replaced by thirty-two robots. They do the work in half the time. And this is not the only advantage: they are more precise, safer and much more cost-effective in the long-run.

Sanys top-seller in the mid-range class: the excavator SY215. Its price: one hundred and ten thousand euros. This makes it cheaper than any competitor model from Europe or United States. Its most spectacular feature: a blackbox that sends all of the recorded vehicle-data to the control centre in China. In real-time. The Chinese produce the twenty-three ton monster in just twenty-four working hours. The specialists have to work under extreme time pressure. This is also the case at the so-called ""marriage section"" - where the heavily swaying, twelve-tonne upper part has to be moved with millimetre precision onto the narrow slewing ring. The specialists also have only ten minutes at this station. So that Sany can deliver excavators at record speed - on the way to becoming the world market leader.

F3FUH9fVC_M,Porsche: High-Level Car Manufacturer | Mega Manufacturing | Free Documentary,"Mega Manufacturing: The Porsche Manufacturer | 4K Engineering Documentary

World's Most Advanced Supercars: Birth of the Automobile: https://youtu.be/LbD8leFCB-I

The Porsche Macan: Mass car production with a level of customization that comes close to manufacturing.  

The Porsche Macan: the most successful horse in the stable of this legendary sports car manufacturer. A compact SUV, combining off-road qualities and everyday versatility with the DNA of a sports car. In its Leipzig factory Porsche produces with 4,300 employees over 90,000 Macan vehicles per year. Every single vehicle: absolutely individual and bespoke manufactured to order. A masterpiece of logistics and engineering design. Retaining their outstanding quality and delivering volume – a balancing act.

Everything begins with the fabrication of the body. Eight hours is all they need for the entire production of a fully galvanized aluminum-steel car body. On more than 35 thousand square meters, a 400-strong robot army supported by people turn pure sheet metal into sub-frames. Around the clock. A perfectly synchronized spectacle with the precision of a clockwork in perpetual motion. 

Each individual Macan car body is checked with utmost precision. The same applies to the paint surface and the assembled car. The extent of the individual quality control is unique in mass production – and for Porsche, an absolute necessity. 

Since the opening of the Leipzig factory, Porsche has invested over EUR 1.3 billion in this facility – and it is always constantly expanding. Protecting the environment is one key aspect of the investments. Energy is saved in the halls through efficient robotic use, and produced on the rooftops from natural solar energy. The photovoltaic system consists of more than 17,500 modules. Immediately behind the assembly halls and the company's own circular track, there is an entirely different world! Here, Porsche has created ecological compensation areas for the sealed ground space. 25 Exmoor ponies and 75 aurochs graze on this managed eco-system.

hG-uwU5oFVM,Custom-Made Volvo Trucks | Mega Manufacturing | Free Documentary,"Mega Manufacturing: Custom-made Volvo Trucks in Belgium | 4K Engineering Documentary

An enormous output and yet, every-truck custom-made: this is Volvo Trucks in Belgium. 

Trucks: Kings of the road with enormous power. Their manufacture demands a good eye, absolute precision and above all: perfect logistics. One of the world's largest truck factories is located in Belgium, close to the romantic town of Ghent. It's the ideal location, close to thousands of customers across Western Europe. This is where Volvo produces its bestseller: the all-time all-rounder ""FH"" - one of the most popular trucks in Europe with the most powerful engines in the industry! Approximately two hundred trucks each day! Each one unique: every truck leaving this factory is different: Mega Manufacturing individually tailored to customer requirements in a feat of logistical perfection. Timed to the minute. Around one thousand five hundred individual parts are installed by the workers in two hundred and ten operations over eight hours from the simple unadorned chassis - to a state of the art truck. 

This Mega Manufacturing takes huge amounts of energy. But suprisingly without CO2 emissions. Volvo Trucks in Belgium was the first carbon-neutral car factory in the world. As early as 2009. 
Green energy, perfect logistics, a gigantic, fully automated warehouse, modern robots: the factory is still high-tech. But nothing works here without well-trained people. Volvo Trucks calls themself a „people factory“. At the moment they are testing how to support their highly-trained workforces with new high-tech equipment: exoskeletons and virtual reality glasses allow workers and computers to become one! It could become the truck factory of the future!

PkBQi62J_k4,Coffee: The future of coffee growing and production | DW Documentary,"Coffee production is no longer what it was thanks to innovative growers and brave farmers. Coffee can now be grown using methods that promote biodiversity in fields, plantations and forests, while also ensuring that farmers earn more.

David Benitez is one of these coffee pioneers. The young agroecologist from Honduras studied the holistic cultivation techniques used by his indigenous ancestors, and found ways to combine these with modern permaculture methods. David now trains other coffee producers. Teaching farmers has huge potential, as 80% of coffee worldwide is still grown by small farmers. By changing the coffee growing methods they use, these small farmers could actually help fight climate change, while increasing their income.

The start-up ""The Coffee Cherry Company” is also helping coffee producers be able to live more comfortably off the fruits of their labor - literally. To make coffee beans only the seeds of coffee cherries are roasted. The pulp of the fruit usually gets discarded. But this company buys this byproduct, and turns it into coffee flour. This healthy and tasty ingredient can be used in cakes, bread and pasta, and has already been dubbed ""the new superfood” in the US. It’s a win-win-model, which provides coffee farmers with another source of income, while also protecting the environment and benefitting consumers.  

Another long-forgotten plant that has been re-discovered are lupines. The flowering plant is native to Germany and is already being used as a base ingredient for tofu and yoghurt alternatives. But this brightly blooming legume has even more to offer, as its beans can also be roasted and brewed. Family Klein has developed their very own stomach-friendly coffee creation, called Lupino. The family has been growing lupines on their organic farm for years, and delivers the lupine coffee to customers across Europe. Thanks to short transport routes and production that consumes less water, Lupino is a climate-friendly alternative to coffee.

vGTwwvo4cek,Pirelli: World&#39;s Most Renowned Tyre Manufacturer | Mega Manufacturing | Free Documentary,"Mega Manufacturing: Pirelli - The most renowned tyre manufacturer in the world | 4K Engineering Documentary

How do you create the perfect tire for the road and for the race track? Pirelli: the most famous tire manufacturer in the world. 

It is the most renowned tyre manufacturer in the world: Pirelli. Their capacity: 75 million car tyres a year. 32,000 employees worldwide, including 1,400 engineers. The most prestigious car manufacturers in the world rely on their experience. We follow the production of the P-Zero, Pirelli's flagship product. It takes: 100 constituent materials, fifteen manufacturing steps, and over 50 performance tests undertaken in high-tech laboratories. All for achieving the best possible compromise between three irreconcilable and contradictory properties: low rolling resistance, strong grip and low wear. Only then will the P Zero, take to the streets of the world. 

In Settimo Torinese, Italy, the company manufactures its high-tech tires on 200,000 square meters of floor space. Natural rubber is the basic raw material for around 130 years. But yet, a tire is so much more than simply rubber. The secrets of this Mega Manufacturing operation lie in the other ingredients too: A precisely measured blend of fillers, antioxidants, plasticizers, and curing agents. A car tire is a complex high-tech product with many individual layers. Up to ten different rubber compounds are required for different zones of the tire. Together with textile fibers and steel wires. Only then tires are able to withstand extreme stresses. 

A new tyre is specially developed for each car brand. The P-Zeros development is based on the experience gathered in the Formula One World Championship, for which Pirelli is the sole supplier. We make a detour to the development and testing department at Pirelli's headquarters in Milan and accompany a new P-Zero to the test track.

Every year, 40 million metric tons of waste end up in the trash cans of German households. Thanks to strict regulations and precise specifications for waste separation, this waste is turned into new raw materials. 

Paper fibers can be reused up to seven times. In addition, the production of recovered paper uses considerably less water and energy than the production of virgin fiber paper. Thanks to state-of-the-art sorting machines equipped with infrared sensors and magnets, up to 150 million metric tons of scrap metal can now be recycled each year.

According to official statistics, the German recycling industry has generated sales of around 11.4 billion euros in recent years. The documentary provides insights into a booming industry and shows how raw materials are extracted from affluent waste.

The Volvo A60 is the largest articulated hauler in the world, capable of transporting up to 55 metric tons of cargo with a total weight of nearly 100 metric tons. Built in southern Sweden, the A60 is the largest vehicle produced in this factory with most parts fitted by robots. The factory had to be converted for the hauler since it is bigger than any other vehicle produced there. The A60 is powered by a six-cylinder inline engine with a displacement of 16 liters and 673 horsepower. The dump body is custom-built in-house and can hold up to around 34 tons. The A60 is affectionately known as the ""beast"" on construction sites around the world.

xqbNuejnP_4,Secrets of the Tomato Industry: The Empire of Red Gold | Food &amp; Agriculture Documentary,"The industrialization of the humble tomato preceded the globalized economy that was to follow. It is now as much of a commodity as wheat, rice, or petrol. The tomato’s ability to create strongly identifiable products, such as ketchup, pizza sauce, soups, sauces, drinks or frozen dishes is unbeatable.

As early as 1897, ten years before Ford started to mass-produce cars, Heinz was already converting tomatoes into standardized cans of puree. They were one of the first companies to understand the power of branding. They banned unions, imposed uniform standards of production and established genetic laboratories that ensured identical tomato plantations all around the world.

Today, wherever you are in the world, you can eat the same tomatoes. This film will trace the journey of tomato paste from Africa, Italy, China and America to show the consequences of this global business.

marn0gET8Qc,Largest Fire Truck Manufacturer | Mega Manufacturing | Free Documentary,"Mega Manufacturing: Pierce - Fire Truck Manufacturer | 4K Engineering Documentary

What is created here is intended to save lives for once: Pierce Manufacturing: the world's largest manufacturer of fire trucks.

It is the largest manufacturer of fire trucks in the world: Pierce Manufacturing in Wisconsin, USA. 1400 trucks are being built here every year – and each truck is one of a kind. Customers determine every detail from the first sketch on the 3D model to the finished truck. More than 13,000 individual components - most of them laboriously crafted by hand - are turned into an absolutely individual fire-fighting vehicle. Even the lettering and coats of arms so popular in North America are the result of Pierce's manual work with brushes and genuine gold leaf. All this is only possible with a lot of experience. The three thousand employees have on average twelve years of professional experience. After all, not just any product is manufactured here, but in case of emergencies their quality is a matter of life and death. The demands placed on a fire -fighting truck are correspondingly high: heavy as a truck, it must nevertheless be extremely manoeuvrable and fast.

Take a mega-frame, a cab equipped with lots of high-tech, a high-performance water pump and a gigantic ladder: We accompany the production of a popular Enforcer fire truck from the very first step - the construction of the chassis - to the final acceptance by the customer. One of the highlights is the assembly of the TAK4 wheel axle. Developed in the military sector, it enables cornering at top speed without tipping over. 

After approximately three months of production, the grand finale is the installation of a gigantic 33-meter turntable ladder on the roof of the Enforcer. A nerve-wracking task for the workers. Using two crane winches, they have to install the component, which weighs tons, with millimetre precision. No cable must be damaged. The final inspection shows whether the installation was successful. Then the customer receives his very own personal emergency vehicle.

✅Can a civilian own an Apache helicopter?

Version without closed captions here: https://youtu.be/H6Jmebz8e14

Funny, provocative and accessible, Manufacturing Consent explores the political life and ideas of Noam Chomsky, world-renowned linguist, intellectual and political activist. Through a collage of biography, archival material, imaginative graphics and outrageous illustrations, Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick's 22-award-winning documentary highlights Chomsky's probing analysis of mass media and his critique of the forces at work behind the daily news.

Viewers are encouraged to extricate themselves from the “web of deceit” by undertaking a course of “intellectual self-defence.” Appearing in the film are leading journalists and critics, including Bill Moyers, William F. Buckley, Jr., Tom Wolfe, Peter Jennings, Jeff Greenfield, Michael Moore, philosopher Michel Foucault, White House reporter Sarah McClendon and New York Times editorial writer Karl E. Meyer. 

Drôle, provocateur et accessible, ce documentaire examine la vie politique et les idées du réputé linguiste, intellectuel et activiste politique Noam Chomsky. Ce film vingt-deux fois primé de Mark Achbar et Peter Wintonick allie éléments biographiques, documents d’archives, graphiques imaginatifs et illustrations scandaleuses pour mettre en lumière l’analyse approfondie que Noam Chomsky a fait des médias de masse et sa critique des forces à l'œuvre derrière les manchettes de l'actualité quotidienne.

Les spectateurs sont encouragé.e.s à se sortir de la ""toile de tromperie"" en entreprenant un cours de ""auto-défense intellectuelle"". Apparaissent dans le film d'éminents journalistes et critiques, dont Bill Moyers, William F. Buckley, Jr., Tom Wolfe, Peter Jennings, Jeff Greenfield, Michael Moore, le philosophe Michel Foucault, la journaliste de la Maison Blanche Sarah McClendon et l'éditorialiste du New York Times Karl E. Meyer.

6VOqNVt_cmM,"Factory farming, animal welfare and the future of modern agriculture | DW Documentary","Factory farming is a mainstay of modern agriculture. In a story told from three very different perspectives, this documentary draws a fascinating and also frightening picture of the status quo.

Pig farmer Dirk Nienhaus grants us a rare glimpse behind the scenes at his modern piggery. He shows how livestock breeding has developed into a high-tech, efficient process - highlighting the fact that factory farming and cheap meat are two sides of the same coin. Dirk Nienhaus sometimes reflects on whether his pigs are suffering and candidly considers his personal role in the system.

Friedrich Mülln views modern farming from the opposing side: the founder of the animal welfare organization SOKO Tierschutz has specialized in publicizing scandalous conditions in factory farms. In the search for evidence of violations, he films in secret at night - the documentary contains some of the footage he manages to capture. Friedrich Mülln outlines why he condemns factory farming outright.

Anja Hradetzky is looking for ways to harmonize livestock farming and animal wellbeing - and finds herself challenging the limits of the system. Her cows live out on the pasture. The calves are raised by their mothers. They’re out in the fields when they’re killed - with a single shot. Nevertheless, questions remain: What constitutes a happy life for animals? Who decides when that life should end? But also: Why is this not the norm in 99 per cent of livestock farms? And why, after so many years, does a farmer like Anja still struggle to make a living?

America is completely underprepared for aircraft warfare when war breaks out.  The Luftwaffe has almost a decade on them in preparation time.  America does not even have a separate air force before the war.  America needs aircraft fast, and in unprecedentedly huge numbers.  But there is no American aircraft company that can even begin to conceive of producing in these numbers.  In fact there is no aircraft manufacturer anywhere in the world that could begin to countenance such an order.  Across the globe up until this point, aircraft product has been a boutique affair, with highly skilled workers catering to a small luxury market.

Henry Ford.  Ford is slow to joint the war effort (in the early years of Nazi rule, he had expressed admiration for them), but he would play more than his part in bringing Hitler down.  Ford sets out with the help of Albert Kahn, to build a giant new factory in Michigan.  It covers an incredibly three and a half million square feet, and includes an aircraft production line half a mile in length.  The factory is called Willow Run.  And it is the largest factory the world has ever seen.

Around 6 million years ago, and we see the emergence of the first hominoids - the family of primates that includes humans.

1.9 Million years ago, Homo Erectus was the first species to leave Africa and colonize other parts of the world. They had larger brains than their primate ancestors. 

Around 400,000 years ago, the first evidence of the Neanderthals. Their bodies were adapted to the cold environments of Europe and Western Asia. Their distinctive facial features were some of the most human-like ever seen. They are famous for their massive body weight and big facial hair. These prehistoric ancestors were made for the cold.

A note on 'Ivan the Terrible' - in Russia, Ivan IV has the epithet 'Гро́зный' meaning 'Great' or 'Formidable'. So why is he known as Ivan 'the Terrible' in English? Because he was evil or useless or because of anti-Russian bias? No, because 'Terrible' in English also means awesome or formidable - this was well understood when 'Гро́зный' was first translated into English centuries ago, but now fewer people understand this. (see definitions 3 & 4 here: http://www.dictionary.com/browse/terr...). The name stuck, and Ivan IV has been known as Ivan the Terrible ever since.

T5PwyuzSYcs,"History of the Entire World (Ancient, Medieval, Modern) | World History Documentary","History of the World attempts to tell the story of humans from Prehistoric times, through the Ancient Period, Middle Ages, and Modern History in a concise movie. It's meant for people who want to have a basic understanding of the major events of human history.

Here is my original 45 minutes HISTORY OF THE WORLD documentary: https://youtu.be/p7DGnK-rvlQ

Human history, or world history, is the narrative of humanity's past. It is understood through archaeology, anthropology, genetics, and linguistics, and since the advent of writing, from primary and secondary sources.

Humanity's written history was preceded by its prehistory, beginning with the Palaeolithic Era (""Old Stone Age""), followed by the Neolithic Era (""New Stone Age""). The Neolithic saw the Agricultural Revolution begin, between 10,000 and 5000 BCE, in the Near East's Fertile Crescent. During this period, humans began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals. As agriculture advanced, most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements. The relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units, fostered by advances in transportation.

Whether in prehistoric or historic times, people always needed to be near reliable sources of drinking water. Settlements developed as early as 4,000 BCE in Iran, in Mesopotamia, in the Indus River valley on the Indian subcontinent, on the banks of Egypt's Nile River, and along China's rivers. As farming developed, grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons. Labour divisions led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities, which provided the foundation for civilization. The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing. Hinduism developed in the late Bronze Age on the Indian subcontinent. The Axial Age witnessed the introduction of religions such as Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Jainism.

With civilizations flourishing, ancient history (""Antiquity,"" including the Classical Age and Golden Age of India, up to about 500 CE) saw the rise and fall of empires. Post-classical history (the ""Middle Ages,"" c. 500–1500 CE,) witnessed the rise of Christianity, the Islamic Golden Age (c. 750 CE – c. 1258 CE), and the Timurid and Italian Renaissances (from around 1300 CE). The mid-15th-century introduction of movable-type printing in Europe revolutionized communication and facilitated ever wider dissemination of information, hastening the end of the Middle Ages and ushering in the Scientific Revolution. The early modern period, sometimes referred to as the ""European Age and Age of the Islamic Gunpowders"", from about 1500 to 1800, included the Age of Discovery and the Age of Enlightenment. By the 18th century, the accumulation of knowledge and technology had reached a critical mass that brought about the Industrial Revolution and began the late modern period, which started around 1800 and has continued through the present.

This scheme of historical periodization (dividing history into Antiquity, Post-Classical, Early Modern, and Late Modern periods) was developed for, and applies best to, the history of the Old World, particularly Europe and the Mediterranean. Outside this region, including ancient China and ancient India, historical timelines unfolded differently. However, by the 18th century, due to extensive world trade and colonization, the histories of most civilizations had become substantially intertwined, a process known as globalization. In the last quarter-millennium, the rates of growth of population, knowledge, technology, communications, commerce, weapon destructiveness, and environmental degradation have greatly accelerated, creating unprecedented opportunities and perils that now confront the planet's human communities.

Hello friends, and  10 million years ago India was pretty much a deserted land, but not anymore. So who came on the deserted land of India and made it golden. Actually they were Sivapithecus and Ramapithecus, India's oldest Homo Erectus Inhabitants, who started the journey of Akhand bharat in the middle of Madhya Pradesh. With time we evolved and became stone age man, who made civilisation in parts of Soan valley, Afghanistan, South-India etc., After that Geographical and climatic changes happened so we had to relocate from Indus river. Now that Indus valley civilization was open land to conquer, various peoples from other regions came to claim it like the Haryanka empire, Alexander the great. But these things were small steps to form our whole Akhand Bharat. So stay tuned till the end of the video to know the history of Akhand Bharat.

5vfL2NzVtaQ,The ENTIRE History of The United Kingdom | History Documentary,"The land of Britain was once considered a myth by the mighty Roman Empire.
To them, it was nothing more than an old legend.

This would change in the year 55 BC, when Julius Caesar set his sights on this fabled island and sailed towards its shores.

The historical discovery would end in defeat.
Almost a century later, the Romans found glory when Roman Emperor Claudius stepped foot on British soil.

Here they conquered magnificent castles and cities, and left their mark on the land. 
They set their eyes on Stonehenge, using the sacred site for their worship and rituals.
Londinium was established, and the Romans seized control of the land.

But what happened next in the history of the United Kingdom? To understand the story of this fascinating land, we must start from the very beginning…

The United Kingdom has played a huge role in developing democracy, literature, and science all around the world. In the 19th century, at the peak of its growth, the British Empire was spread over a quarter of the globe. In fact, It was once said that the sun never sets on the British Empire, which is a testament to how much influence the country had on the world.
We will take a look right back to the birth of the country, which was to become one of the most powerful and widespread civilizations on the planet.

ibjUpk9Iagk,The history of chocolate - Deanna Pucciarelli,"View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-history-of-chocolate-deanna-pucciarelli

 If you can’t imagine life without chocolate, you’re lucky you weren’t born before the 16th century. Until then, chocolate only existed as a bitter, foamy drink in Mesoamerica. So how did we get from a bitter beverage to the chocolate bars of today? Deanna Pucciarelli traces the fascinating and often cruel history of chocolate.

Lesson by Deanna Pucciarelli, animation by TED-Ed.",History
gTGVggo-y00,The Cruelest Rulers In History,"When we think of the evilest rulers in history, names like Joseph Stalin, and Benito Mussolini rush to mind. But it's important to remember that brutality existed in rulers well before the 1930s.

Others, like Attila the Hun or Chinese Empress Wu, may seem like obvious choices. But after looking deeper at the effects of their rule and how they were perceived by those they reigned over, it becomes clear that they're not the worst rulers in history. Instead, they suffered from then-contemporary historians' ire (Attila because he wasn't Roman, and Wu because she was a woman).

lv1SpwwJEW8,"Gaza, explained","Why Palestinians in Gaza have suffered for decades.

Subscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

On October 7, Hamas, a militant group based in the Gaza Strip, launched a deadly attack on Israel, killing over 1,400 Israelis and kidnapping over 200. In retaliation, Israeli airstrikes have killed, as of this video, over 6,400 Palestinians in Gaza, where Palestinians have lived for decades under an occupation and blockade. 

Since 1967, Israel has imposed tight restrictions on travel and essential goods such as food, fuel, medicine, and water in its occupied territories. In 2007, those restrictions became even tighter in Gaza after Hamas seized power there. Since then, it has been nearly impossible for Palestinians to leave Gaza or to access an adequate supply of essential goods.

Today, the Gaza Strip, with a population of over 2 million Palestinians, is a victim of what many call “collective punishment” as Israel bombards its population, shuts off access to internet, power, food, water, and medicine, forces them to leave their homes, and prepares for a ground invasion.

This latest episode of Vox Atlas explains how the experience of Palestinians in Gaza got to this point, and what’s behind Israel’s occupation and its blockade of Gaza. 

Sources and readings: 

Thank you for watching! We know we couldn’t cover everything about the Gaza Strip, this was just a start. Below are a couple of sources and readings you might find helpful to learn more. 

Gisha, an Israeli nonprofit that works to protect freedom of movement for Palestinians, has done so much research on the closure of Gaza and how it impacts Palestinians there. Below are the reports and visuals that we found most useful.

https://www.gisha.org/UserFiles/File/publications/Map2020/English2020.pdf

Visualizing Palestine, a nonprofit that uses data and research to make visuals, and B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization, have useful databases that track fatalities over time in the Gaza Strip, Israel, and the West Bank.

8VKnGdl4Q3U,Mystery of Ancient Pyramids | How were they really built? | Dhruv Rathee,"You must have seen several pictures of Egyptian Pyramids. We all agree that they are really beautiful - but have you ever thought about who built them, and how were they built? Because they were built at a time when there was no machinery, no infrastructure, no technology, nothing. So what is the story behind these giant structures that weigh 6 million tons? Why are they shaped like that? How were the stones transported? Watch this video by Dhruv Rathee to find out as he deep dives into the mystery of Giza Pyramids.

For game details (and text in the bottom left):
- Text should refer to the version of a game being mentioned in the video. If the version shown isn't obvious it should be indicated in brackets but usually what's shown should correlate to what I'm saying (the arcade version is used in arcade sections, console is console sections etc.). 
- The date refers to the first release (often Japanese) of that version of the game. For console games this means the console release, not any earlier arcade release date.
- The name of the developer is used rather than publisher, but in-house first party studios are usually shortened/simplified. For example Nintendo R&D1 is listed as just Nintendo, Square Enix Business Division 2 would be listed as Square Enix. Etc.
- Footage from remasters and remakes was (mostly) avoided but lots of what's shown is original games emulated at a higher resolution than the original console. This makes some games look better than they really were, but older games also benefited greatly from being shown on CRT displays so I think this sort of balances out. Regardless, I tried to strike a balance between authenticity and visual quality but don't take what you see as absolute gospel.
- I'm sure there are typos somewhere but it is what it is. Typos aren't so bad, they just remind you this was made by a human. A rather tired human.

Lyrics

[Harry:]
You gotta help me, I'm losing my mind
Keep getting the feeling you wanna leave this all behind
Thought we were going strong
I thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

[Niall:]
No, they don't teach you this in school
Now my heart's breaking and I don't know what to do
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

[All:]
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

[Liam:]
All of the rumors, all of the fights
But we always find a way to make it out alive
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

[All:]
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

[Louis:]
Mini bars, expensive cars, hotel rooms, and new tattoos
And the good champagne, and private planes, but they don't mean anything
'Cause the truth is out, I realize that without you here life is just a lie
This is not the end
This is not the end

In this video, Dhruv Rathee dives deep into the captivating tale of the Mona Lisa. Set in the bustling city of Paris, an audacious theft occurs at the Louvre Museum. The mastermind, Vincenzo Peruggia, along with accomplices Michele Lancelotti and Vincenzo, manage to steal Leonardo da Vinci's iconic painting, the Mona Lisa. Astonishingly, the theft has remained unnoticed for nearly 30 hours. Eventually, the world is alerted to the crime, and even the legendary artist Pablo Picasso is questioned! The painting remains missing for 16 months, and its return to the Louvre only adds to its global fame. We then delve into the woman's identity depicted in the painting, Lisa Gherardini, and the various theories surrounding her. The painting's artistic traits, the science behind Mona Lisa's elusive smile, and the discovery of another possible version of the painting are also discussed. Join us as we unravel the mysteries behind one of the world's most celebrated artworks and its intriguing history.

How long did it take you to make this video?

What software/equipment did you use to make this video?
After effects, Illustrator, Premier Pro, Audacity, Yeti microphone,

Tea is the second most consumed beverage in the world after water — and from sugary Turkish Rize tea to salty Tibetan butter tea, there are almost as many ways of preparing the beverage as there are cultures on the globe. Where did this beverage originate, and how did it become so popular? Shunan Teng details tea’s long history.

The Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother’s side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun’s triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.

Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue

KhDY4KJuvc0,Indus Valley Civilization Facts - History of Ancient India | Educational Videos by Mocomi,"https://mocomi.com/ presents: Ancient Civilizations - The Indus Valley Civilization

One of the earliest urban civilizations in India and in fact, in the world, was the Indus Valley Civilization, also called the Harappan Culture.

About 5000 years ago, a group of nomads traveling from Sumeria (present-day Iran) entered North Western India, near present day Karachi. These nomads found a land so richly fertile by the banks of the river Indus that they settled there without hesitation. This area was abundant with water, fodder and fuel.

Over the next thousand years, the immigrants spread over an area of half a million square miles. Excavations prove that the level of urban planning and architecture prevalent here was incomparable. The anchor for this civilization lay in the beautiful twin cities of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa.

The name Mohenjo-Daro means ‘Mound of the Dead’ in Sindhi. The city was built around 2600 BC and abandoned around 1700 BC. Evidence suggests that the city was highly prone to floods.

Watch this video to learn about this civilization and its way of life.

--------------------------------------

The history of our story began long ago, 

At one point in time, around three billion years ago, we were floating around as little, tiny atoms in the little Petri dish of the world.

Around 6 million years ago, and we see the emergence of the first hominoids - the family of primates that includes humans.

1.9 Million years ago, Homo Erectus was the first species to leave Africa and colonize other parts of the world. They had larger brains than their primate ancestors. 

Around 400,000 years ago, the first evidence of the Neanderthals. Their bodies were adapted to the cold environments of Europe and Western Asia. Their distinctive facial features were some of the most human-like ever seen. They are famous for their massive body weight and big facial hair. These prehistoric ancestors were made for the cold.

Then came us; 300,000 years ago, the first Homo Sapiens roamed the earth. The Only surviving species of the Homo Genus. But how did Homo Sapiens rise into a global dominance through the mechanism of civilization?

s29Q9EIbDT8,The Soviet Union | Part 1: Red October to Barbarossa | Free Documentary History,"The Soviet Union - Part 1: Red October to Barbarossa | History Documentary 

Watch ' The Soviet Union - Part 2' here: https://youtu.be/zYB3gj5t_dg

The Soviet Union was officially formed in 1922, a country, a political experiment, an ideal, a great scar across history…  

Officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the USSR was a one-party state, governed, controlled, and tormented by a single-party rule. That of the Communist Party. No nation has inflicted such destruction on its own population in the name of progress. Power corroded the leadership, leaving the masses to suffer in the name of history. The very people who were supposed to be governing themselves.  

There are many factors that affected the Soviet Union’s turbulent history, but the sheer ungovernable vastness of the country was inescapable. It was a nation the size of a continent stretching from Moscow to Vladivostok and from Leningrad to Stalingrad. What we might consider European Russia was dwarfed by the reaches of Siberia. Enacting any kind of policy took force.  Complicated, contradictory figureheads would come and go, men, who held this impossible country it seemed by sheer will. Stalin the despot-hero whose cruelty knew few bounds united a nation to defeat Hitler. Khrushchev the crafty libertarian, who preached reform yet allowed an arms race to escalate. Brezhnev, that unreadable member of the old guard, sent history backward. And of course, Gorbachev, who brought vast change, modernization, and détente, yet saw the Soviet Union collapse under his rule – the untenable nation.  

Over many painful years, this vast country locked itself away from the rest of the world, paranoid, economically uncertain, and repressive, while still casting a vast shadow across the world. The 20th century was shaped by its convulsions, its purges, its wars, and its leaders.

Embark on a journey beginning with the Astors, known as America’s first multimillionaires. Their story is a riveting tale of ambition and ingenuity, setting the stage for an era where wealth was a measure of success. Learn how the Astor family, through shrewd business tactics and social prowess, laid the foundations of what would become the elite “High Society” of New York.

The Morgans, America's first banking dynasty, are also a central feature of this film. Discover how their financial acumen and influence in banking circles not only shaped their own legacy but also the economic landscape of the United States.

Watch 'Operation Thunderbolt: The Raid on Entebbe' here: https://youtu.be/SWhCg49zm64

The bitter struggle between Arab and Jew for control of the Holy Land has caused untold suffering in the Middle East for generations. It is often claimed that the crisis originated with Jewish emigration to Palestine and the foundation of the state of Israel. Yet the roots of the conflict are to be found much earlier – in British double-dealing during the First World War. This is a story of intrigue among rival empires; of misguided strategies; and of how conflicting promises to Arab and Jew created a legacy of bloodshed which determined the fate of the Middle East.

This is followed by a quick overview of the Crusades and religious orders, and then the Late Middle Ages, going over the Black Death, Hundred Years War, and Western Schism.

RW105kjNtho,What Ignited The Ongoing Palestine vs Israel Conflict | Promises &amp; Betrayals | Timeline,"This is how British double-dealing during WW1 ignited the conflict between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East. This is a story of intrigue among rival empires; of misguided strategies; and of how conflicting promises to Palestine and Israel created a legacy of bloodshed which determined the fate of the Middle East. Avi Shlaim, Professor of International Relations at Oxford University, calls it 'one of the best historical documentaries on the Middle East I have ever seen'.

5vfL2NzVtaQ,The ENTIRE History of The United Kingdom | History Documentary,"The land of Britain was once considered a myth by the mighty Roman Empire.
To them, it was nothing more than an old legend.

This would change in the year 55 BC, when Julius Caesar set his sights on this fabled island and sailed towards its shores.

The historical discovery would end in defeat.
Almost a century later, the Romans found glory when Roman Emperor Claudius stepped foot on British soil.

Here they conquered magnificent castles and cities, and left their mark on the land. 
They set their eyes on Stonehenge, using the sacred site for their worship and rituals.
Londinium was established, and the Romans seized control of the land.

But what happened next in the history of the United Kingdom? To understand the story of this fascinating land, we must start from the very beginning…

The United Kingdom has played a huge role in developing democracy, literature, and science all around the world. In the 19th century, at the peak of its growth, the British Empire was spread over a quarter of the globe. In fact, It was once said that the sun never sets on the British Empire, which is a testament to how much influence the country had on the world.
We will take a look right back to the birth of the country, which was to become one of the most powerful and widespread civilizations on the planet.

00:00 🇷🇺 Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, is celebrated as a hero but is actually one of the greatest criminals in history.
8:41 🌍 Stalin's ambition to create a communist utopia in the Soviet Union is met with challenges and a deteriorating quality of life for the population.
16:49 🔴 Stalin's brutal reign and his implementation of political trials and mass repressions.
25:02 😢 Stalin's famine in Ukraine leads to the death of millions of people, while the French delegation is deceived by propaganda.
33:08 😱 The construction of the Stalin Canal was a tragic and cruel event, resulting in the deaths of thousands of prisoners and ultimately being a failure.
41:38 ⚡ The Great Terror: Stalin's purges and executions
50:02 😔 Stalin fails to recognize the threat of Hitler and the Soviet Union is unprepared for war.
59:46 🇷🇺 Stalin's leadership during World War II, including the Battle of Stalingrad, solidified the Soviet Union as a superpower.
1:10:23 🇷🇺 Stalin celebrates victory in Berlin and demands half of Europe at the Potsdam Conference.
1:18:55 🌍 The people of Grigny wish a happy birthday to Stalin and praise his leadership.

Through the most significant events of his time, we discover the legacy of terror and destruction that Stalin bequeathed to his people.
On March 9, 1953, Joseph Stalin died in Moscow. His funeral was that of a demigod. Last irony of one of the worst criminals in the history of the 20th century, who brought misery to his people while creating a collective admiration. During more than 30 years of absolute rule, millions of people died.
With Stalin's policy the standard of living fell. The poverty of the early 1930s was evident on the streets of Moscow. In his labor re-education camps, better known as the Gulag, he imprisoned 18 million Russians, turning them into slaves. Machiavellian and paranoid, Stalin invented the impeachment trial, where sentences were set before the start of the hearing. He starved 7,000,000 peasants to death as punishment for refusing his revolution. He had fooled the entire world through false propaganda campaigns.
During World War II, Adolf Hitler set out to destroy Stalin. On June 16, 1941, three million soldiers attacked the USSR. The Nazis took over the city of Stalingrad, which was finally liberated by Russian troops in November 1942. In February 1943 the German troops surrendered. With this victory, Stalin became the first leader to defeat Hitler, which gave him the recognition of the international community.",History

To many, the origin of the Bible can be summed-up as follows: ""A mere translation of a translation of an interpretation of an oral tradition"" - and therefore, a book with no credibility or connection to the original texts. Actually, the foregoing statement is a common misunderstanding of both Christians and non-christians alike. Translations such as the King James Version are derived from existing copies of ancient manuscripts such as the Hebrew Masoretic Text (Old Testament) and the Greek Textus Receptus (New Testament), and are not translations of texts translated from other interpretations. The primary differences between today's Bible translations are merely related to how translators interpret a word or sentence from the original language of the text source (Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek).

Origin of the Bible - The Reliability of Ancient Manuscripts
Another challenge against the origin of the Bible is the reliability of the manuscripts from which today's Bibles are translated. Remarkably, there is widespread evidence for absolute reliability. There are more than 14,000 existing Old Testament manuscripts and fragments copied throughout the Middle East, Mediterranean and European regions that agree dramatically with each other. In addition, these texts agree with the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, which was translated from Hebrew to Greek some time during the 3rd century BC. The Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in Israel in the 1940's and 50's, also provide phenomenal evidence for the reliability of the ancient transmission of the Jewish Scriptures (Old Testament) before the arrival of Jesus Christ. The Hebrew scribes who copied the Jewish Scriptures dedicated their lives to preserving the accuracy of the holy books. These scribes went to phenomenal lengths to insure manuscript reliability. They were highly trained and meticulously observed, counting every letter, word and paragraph against master scrolls. A single error would require the immediate destruction of the entire text. 

The manuscript evidence for the New Testament is also dramatic, with over 5,300 known copies and fragments in the original Greek, nearly 800 of which were copied before 1000 AD. Some manuscript texts date to the early second and third centuries, with the time between the original autographs and our earliest existing copies being a remarkably short 60 years. Interestingly, this manuscript evidence far surpasses the manuscript reliability of other ancient writings that we trust as authentic every day. Look at these comparisons: Julius Caesar's ""The Gallic Wars"" (10 manuscripts remain, with the earliest one dating to 1,000 years after the original autograph); Pliny the Younger's ""History"" (7 manuscripts; 750 years elapsed); Thucydides' ""History"" (8 manuscripts; 1,300 years elapsed); Herodotus' ""History"" (8 manuscripts; 1,300 years elapsed); Sophocles (193 manuscripts; 1,400 years); Euripides (9 manuscripts; 1,500 years); and Aristotle (49 manuscripts; 1,400 years). 

Homer's ""Iliad"", the most renowned book of ancient Greece, has 643 copies of manuscript support. In those copies, there are 764 disputed lines of text, as compared to 40 lines in all the New Testament manuscripts (Norman L. Geisler and William E. Nix, A General Introduction to the Bible, Moody, Chicago, Revised and Expanded 1986, p. 367). In fact, many people are unaware that each of William Shakespeare's 37 plays (written in the 1600's) have gaps in the surviving manuscripts, forcing scholars to ""fill in the blanks."" This pales in textual comparison with the over 5,300 copies and fragments of the New Testament that, together, assure us that nothing's been lost. In fact, all of the New Testament except eleven verses can be reconstructed from the writings of the early church fathers in the second and third centuries.

8-rqLOx96a4,The repercussion of the atomic bombing in Hiroshima | History Calls | FULL DOCUMENTARY,"In the summer of 1945, the nightmare is ending for thousands of soldiers. In Japan, the situation is desperate. The Empire of the Rising Sun no longer has the means to continue the war. It can't stem the American advance. Its centres of industry have been systematically destroyed by the US Air Force's bombardments, its supply lines all cut off.

The people of Japan are preparing to face the unthinkable; and in the corridors of power, too, many of their leaders are resigned to the war being lost. But the ministers cannot accept the shame and the risks of an unnegotiated surrender. 

They must maintain the Emperor on his throne, to preserve the very essence of Japan and the military traditions it represents.

xsulFNLHhio,The 3000-Year-Old Library of Ashurbanipal | 4K History Documentary (Ancient Mesopotamia),"The Assyrian Empire would rule over the northern Mesopotamian lands for over 1500 years. The last great king of the empire, Ashurbanipal, constructed a grand library which contained thousands of secrets of this once great empire. 
In 612 BC, a coalition led by the Babylonians would topple the reign of the civilization, and the king’s extraordinary library went down in flames, leaving the empire’s story a forever mystery. 

That is, until 1849.

English Archaeologist Austen Henry Layard returned from an excavation in Modern-day Iraq, telling his people about his magnificent find.

The fire which engulfed the now buried library had dried the clay tablets, preserving them for millenia. The library’s chambers were excavated for years to follow and 30,000 clay tablets would be translated.
This discovery would be known as ""the most precious source of historical material in the world."" - H.G Wells

Ashurbanipal was a king known to torture and kill, yet he never left his palace to go to battle. Instead, he stayed inside his palace walls and wrote. He'd spend the day studying the great tablets of clay his soldiers brought him, of which we will be exploring today.

D4ZF70ogq0I,Ku Klux Klan - An American History | Part 1 | Free Documentary History,"Ku Klux Klan - An American History: Part 1 | American History Documentary

Watch 'Ku Klux Klan - An American History: Part 2' here: https://youtu.be/Lfqq2iu2pFo

The Ku Klux Klan is the oldest terrorist group in the United States. This secret society, created
in 1865, has survived throughout the decades and has always managed to rise from its ashes.
It has been making the news for over 150 years. 150 years of hatred, racism and horror. A
cruel history whose demons still haunt America.

Part 1: 
In 1865, a handful of Southern Civil War veterans founded a secret society: the Ku
Klux Klan. Very quickly, the Klan instituted a reign of terror among the recently freed black
population. Murders and lynchings were common. In Washington, Congress launched an
offensive against the invisible empire, which was officially destroyed in 1872. The Ku Klux
Klan was reborn in 1915 thanks to the film The Birth of a Nation by D. W. Griffith. Under new
leadership, it evolved to fit into an America undergoing major changes and broadened its
trade in hatred. The KKK became anti-immigrant, anti-urban, anti-communist, anti-Semitic,
and anti-Catholic. Nearly four million Americans joined what would become a highly
influential mass lobbying organization. But at the end of the 1920s, scandals and the
economic crisis weakened the movement, which eventually disappeared again after the
Second World War.

S0C9uJMQicE,OLDEST RELIGIONS: the Entire History | 4K FULL DOCUMENTARY,"#4k #religion #documentary 
http://www.patreon.com/gnosticinformant

We break down the most ancient forms of nature worship, to Paganism, down to the Syncretic Roman Imperial Cult and Judeo-Christian and Islamic Monotheistic Religions.

Ancient religions have been a part of human history since the Stone Age. These religions were often based on animism, the belief that everything in nature has a spirit or soul. As humans evolved, so did their religious beliefs. The ancient Egyptians believed in a pantheon of gods and goddesses who controlled the forces of nature and the afterlife.

Proto-Indo-European pantheons were the earliest recorded religious beliefs of the Indo-European peoples. These pantheons were polytheistic, meaning they believed in multiple gods and goddesses, and often had a focus on nature and the elements.

Moving forward in time, we can look at the ancient Greek and Roman religions, which were heavily influenced by the earlier Indo-European beliefs. The Greeks had a pantheon of gods and goddesses, with Zeus as the king of the gods and a focus on mythology and storytelling. The Romans, on the other hand, had a more practical approach to religion, with a focus on rituals and ceremonies to appease the gods.

The Etruscan religion was the religious belief system of the Etruscan civilization, which was located in central Italy from the 8th to the 3rd century BCE. The Etruscans believed in a pantheon of gods and goddesses, and their religion was heavily influenced by the Greeks. They also believed in the concept of divination, and used various methods such as reading the entrails of animals to predict the future. The Etruscan religion played an important role in the development of Roman religion, as many of the Roman gods and goddesses were based on Etruscan deities. However, much of the Etruscan religion has been lost to history, as many of their religious texts and artifacts were destroyed over time.

During the Augustan age, the Roman religion underwent significant changes, with the emperor Augustus promoting a more traditional and conservative approach to religion. This included a focus on the worship of the state gods, as well as the deification of the emperor himself.

In ancient Greece, religion was intertwined with daily life and politics. The Greeks believed in a pantheon of gods and goddesses who controlled different aspects of life. The Romans adopted many of the Greek gods and goddesses, but also had their own deities.

Judaism originated in the Middle East around 2000 BCE and evolved over time, with the Hebrew Bible serving as a central text. Early Judaism was characterized by a strong emphasis on monotheism, the belief in one God, and the importance of following God's laws and commandments. The Jewish people also placed great importance on the concept of covenant, or the special relationship between God and the Jewish people. 

As Christianity emerged in the Middle East, it spread rapidly throughout the Roman Empire. Christianity was based on the teachings of Jesus Christ, who preached love, forgiveness, and salvation. The religion became the dominant faith in Europe during the Middle Ages.

Islam emerged in the 7th century in the Arabian Peninsula. The religion was founded by the prophet Muhammad, who received revelations from Allah. Islam spread rapidly throughout the Middle East and North Africa, and eventually reached Europe and Asia.


Today, Christianity and Islam are the two largest religions in the world. Christianity has over 2 billion followers, while Islam has over 1.5 billion. Both religions have had a profound impact on human history and continue to shape the world today.


In conclusion, ancient religions have played a significant role in human history. From animism to modern Christianity and Islam, religion has shaped the way humans view the world and interact with each other. While the specific beliefs and practices of these religions may differ, they all share a common goal of providing meaning and purpose to human life.

Starting with the underclass, we will witness the plight of poor children forced into work in dangerous factories, risking their lives during the industrial revolution. The middle classes, who lived in a perpetual state of uncertainty, despite holding skilled jobs. Some had a clear view of their circumstances while working in service for affluent families in grand estates. The upper classes, born into generational wealth, inherited vast estates. While many thrived, some faced immense pressure to uphold the strict order and expectations of aristocratic society. Although each section of society had its own trappings, some certainly benefitted from this rigid system more than others.

EPYstHyYNSA,The Forgotten Era: What Really Happened AFTER the Dinosaurs Went Extinct ? Earth History Documentary,"🌍 Today, many extinct animals are more familiar to us than some species that are still alive. Among them are the dinosaurs. The diplodocus is more famous than the aardvark, and the tyrannosaurus more famous than the peramete. Dinosaurs are part of popular culture. For over 160 million years, these majestic creatures dominated the Earth, occupying most ecological niches and leaving little room for other species.

On five occasions, the Earth was confronted with major upheavals that had a fundamental impact on its subsequent history. When they disappeared during the fifth mass extinction, the dinosaurs left an immeasurable void. But one man's misfortune is another man's gain, and this void enabled the evolution of mammals and birds, which are now highly diversified groups of animals. Without this extinction, dinosaurs would probably have continued to dominate life on Earth, and other animals would not have had the opportunity to make their mark.  

Mass extinctions change the rules of the game, redistributing the cards by condemning certain groups and giving new opportunities to others. When the dinosaurs disappeared, our distant ancestors survived.

What did the Earth look like after the extinction of the dinosaurs?




🔥 As a reminder, videos are published on SUNDAYS at 6pm.


-------------------------

💥 How did life on Earth recover after the cataclysm that brought down the gigantic dinosaurs?  : 
- A mass extinction is an event that resembles a relatively brief biological crisis on the scale of geological time. At least 75% of animal and plant species disappear from the face of the Earth. Over the last 500 million years, life on the planet has undergone five mass extinctions. Today, over 99% of all organisms that have ever lived on Earth have disappeared.

The phenomenon of species extinction is no longer surprising. Species are deadly. Each of the great mass extinctions has played a role in the history of the living world, forcing it into new directions as decimated fauna and flora are forced to evolve.

The Ordovician-Silurian extinction took place 444 million years ago. A geological event triggered an episode of glaciation. Considerable quantities of water became trapped in an ice cap three times the size of present-day Antarctica. This event led to the disappearance of 85% of all terrestrial species.

The Devonian extinction began 383 million years ago. Probably due to a strong volcanic episode, pulses caused a sudden drop in oxygen levels in the oceans. 75% of species disappeared during this mass extinction.

The third mass extinction, the Permian-Triassic, took place 252 million years ago. It was the worst catastrophe ever experienced by life on Earth. Over 90% of all species were killed. The destroyed forests will need more than 10 million years to recover.

Around 200 million years ago, the Earth suffered the Triassic-Jurassic extinction. Geological events caused a warming of the Earth's surface and an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This was a further blow to life on Earth, which lost up to 80% of its terrestrial and marine species.

The fifth and final mass extinction was the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction, which caused the disappearance of the famous non-avian dinosaurs.

LYRICS

When the Cotillion arrived
We threw out the television
Model D 575
Has custom flute presets
And Harmony-Plus in addition

Now for an arm and a leg
We get three half-dozen beats to choose from
So now we can pretend
That there's an orchestra in the loungeroom

I put the Genie Bass on
So my left hand can play the choir
With 16ft Diapason
And Lowrey's patented Orchestral Symphonizer

Banjo's great on repeat
The kids want to play but they'll have to be patient
The wife can't help tapping her feet
It's a genuine home entertainment revelation

State of the art
(Hold the phone, it's so)
State of the art
[Listen to the difference!]
(Oh my god, it's so)
State of the art
[By use of a computer]
State of the art

Now we don't want to go out
When we could spend the night at home with the Cotillion
Invite the neighbours around
Start the bossanova beat and limbo from the living to the kitchen

Enjoy the state of the art
The Magic Swing Piano really is astounding
Now we can't tell them apart
But these amazing simulations end up sounding even better than the real thing

State of the art
(Hold the phone, it's so)
[Computer controlled tone colour]
State of the art
[The marriage of music to computers is quite natural]
(Oh my god, it's so)
State of the art
[It is time to hear the results]",Art and Music

Lyrics:
What a time
Kinda sucks
That the night ends like this

I won’t call
But can we call
This for what it is

Weekends
Staring at the ceiling
Holding up the pretense
We could ever be friends when we

Both know we should hit unfollow
Taking down the pictures
Is the hardest pill to swallow

There’s no pretty way to break a heart
Breaking up is modern art

One by one
Tell our friends
All our practiced lines

Pull the frames
Double coat
Different paint this time

Now I spend my weeknights
Blowing out the street lights
No one on my left it’s
Kinda hard to sleep right when we

Both know we should hit unfollow
You’re not in the story
You still watch them all though

There’s no pretty way to break a heart
Breaking up is modern art

►Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I’ve ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices, they come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming one day I’ll watch as you’re leaving ‘cause you got tired of my scheming - for the last time

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I’m a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman 
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming 
one day I’ll watch as you’re leaving and life will lose all its meaning - for the last time 

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers ‘round and reads it
And then someone screams out
“She’s laughing up at us from hell!”

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me

It’s me
Hi

Everybody agrees
Everybody agrees

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

This video is part of an ongoing project to cover the entire Dark Side of the Moon album with A.I. visuals, it's a group project that should be released soon on this channel! Stay tuned : )


Further Explanation:

It's not hard to understand, but it's difficult to explain.

Basically, the A.I. works much like our brains, in that it develops unique pattern recognition of particular visual elements or some given art piece and it's related context.

And in this case, I use that model to reinterpret a video I made, one of me singing in front of a greenscreen and moving my head around to the pink floyd song ""time"" at 2x speed, meaning that I sped up the song.  

Then I slowed down that recorded footage of me, to make it normal speed with the original song, and edited the greenscreens color to have more trippy looking visuals, and rendered out that video

then I gave that rendered video to an A.I. to reinterpret.  I gave it specific prompts to try and re interpret the footage into, like roman statue head or what ever it might be.  in this case I made a custom model as well of my old highschool art teachers art because I like his art so much.",Art and Music

“Exhibits” has been in the works for more than a year and a half, but will finally get unleashed to the legions of hungry melodic rock fans that this band has enraptured with their first three albums. ""It’s been a long time indeed, five years!” says guitarist and producer Robert Sall. ""Funny enough, it didn’t seem that way. Everyone in the band was busy doing their own thing and it wasn’t until mid-2017 when Serafino [Perugino, President Frontiers Records] asked us about our plans for a new album and it hit us that, it REALLY was about time. So we spent the better part of 2018 writing and recording it and here we are!""

Work Of Art debuted in February 2008 with the release of their album “Artwork”. Coming out of nowhere, the album immediately struck a chord with melodic rock aficionados around the world. With a sound inspired by genre greats like Toto, Giant, and Journey, Work Of Art quickly established themselves as one of the most promising newcomers in the genre. Soon after their debut, WOA guitarist and main composer Robert Sall joined W.E.T, the project featuring Jeff Scott Soto and Erik Martensson from Eclipse, thus immediately cementing his status as a star in the genre!

Expectations for the follow-up album, “In Progress” were sky high. Work of Art lived up to the hype, entering the Swedish album charts at number 30 upon release of the album. The next step for the band was to start performing live, which they did for the first time in Madrid, Spain in January 2012 and followed that performance with several other shows in various European countries. Third album “Framework” followed in 2014 and kept the momentum going for the band which, simply put, became the top new AOR band from Europe. 

“Exhibits” is therefore the logical next step for WOA, an album which encompasses all that they have managed to create until now. Offering another bunch of unforgettable songs with soaring melodies (courtesy of singer Lars Säfsund) and amazing instrumental prowess (offered by Robert and Herman), ""Exhibits"" will thrill fans of the band and of the genre as a whole. ""Like always, when Herman, Lars and I get together, it sounds like us, it sounds like Work of Art,” tells Sall. ""However, with this record I tried to bring out more ”old school AOR” influences and get rid of some of the West Coast influences that were on our previous albums. I wanted it to be an AOR album, not a melodic rock album, not a West Coast album, just a classic AOR sounding album, start to finish!""

Overall this is certainly Work of Art’s most up-tempo and straight ahead album thus far, but – as it should be – some unbelievable softer moments are there as well. One notable highlight, legendary keyboard player Vince DiCola (author of the immortal “Training Montage” piece on the Rocky IV soundtrack) is a special guest on “This Isn’t Love.”

If you are an AOR fan this is a record you simply cannot miss!

Lyrics: 

Yeah I’m telling you, in times like these 
Everyone thinks they know it better 
And they don't stop bugging
But all that remains is
don't give up and now get sucked in, yeah
Let them drown in their downside
Running confused and searching on the outside 
There's no alternative but to go your own way 
No matter what they say

Try
You shouldn't have to lie
Give it another try
Cause if we don't we're broken deep inside 

We have to find our Why
We always have to try
Till we see the last sparks of daylight die

Throw caution to the wind and stop wasting your time 
Don't give a shit
Nothing's gonna change your mind
Keep on truckin’ and leave no stone unturned 
Because no one is aware of the fire that burns
Nothing can kill your Dream stone-dead 
Let’s dream your Dream til the greatest end 
Put on your fighter uniform
And now weather the storm

Now get it out, out of your system
You gotta dare to do what you really want to 
No matter how many times you fail
It's all about getting up once again

Ok, get it out of your system
Well, then get off your ass and make it count",Art and Music

Lyrics:

Ye munasib hoga hamko thaamlo ke
Ham bhi chaand dhoondne lage hain badalon mein
Naam shamil ho chuka hai apna pagalon mein

Matlabi is duniya se kinaare karlun
Naam tere saari ki saari bahaarein kardun
Bas chale to tere hath mein sitaare rakhdun

Shaam ka rang kyon
Tere rang se mil raha hai

Dil mera tere sang
Baith kar kyon khil raha hai

Hai koi jawaab
O mere janaab
Hai koi jawaab
Is baat ka

Aapke apne hi hain hamko jaaniye to
Is sharam ke lehje ko pehchaniye to
Baat ban jayegi baat maniye to

Kya hai kuch nahi ye char din ki zindagani
Taaron ke her fer ki ye karistani
Na kabhi bhi mitne wali likh dein kahani

Aapki aankhon mein jo likha hai wo main padh raha hun

Baat wo honth par kab aayegi
Intezaar kar raha hun

Hai koi jawaab
O mere janaab
Hai koi jawaab

Bunte rahein 
Ya na bune ye khaab
Hai koi jawaab
Is baat ka

Lyrics:

I know sometimes
It feels like no one’s listening 
Like you’re the only one who hears your own prayers
Just know, we all feel that way
Sometimes you gotta pick yourself up
And just know…

Even when you’re falling apart
There’s somebody lookin’ in on you like you’re a piece of art
Even when life runs you down
You gotta turn the other way and just look around because
Nine times out of ten
The only enemy that you perceive really wanted to be your friend

I hate to see you falling apart like this
They told you not to play the card game, but you gambled a bit
You took a risk, yes, I’ll admit that was bold of you
You know that in your soul it’s true
Be careful what you hold on to

Be careful what you hold on to
Be careful what you hold on to
Be careful what you hold on to
Cause it could really get a hold on you

You know I’m feeling like I’m falling
You know I’m feeling like I’m falling
You know I feel like I’m falling
So if you’re feeling like you’re falling
Just know that in your soul
You’re a piece of art",Art and Music

Lyrics:
There's a shadow just behind me
Shrouding every step I take
Making every promise empty
Pointing every finger at me
Waiting like a stalking butler
Who upon the finger rests
Murder now the path of must we
Just because the son has come

Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past and done?
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past and done?

Why can't we not be sober?
Just want to start this over
And why can't we drink forever?
I just want to start this over

I am just a worthless liar
I am just an imbecile
I will only complicate you
Trust in me and fall as well
I will find a center in you
I will chew it up and leave
I will work to elevate you
Just enough to bring you down

Mother Mary, won't you whisper?
Something but what's past and done
Mother Mary, won't you whisper?
Something but the past and done

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over
And why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over
Why?

I am just a worthless liar
I am just an imbecile
I will only complicate you
Trust in me and fall as well
I will find a center in you
I will chew it up and leave

Trust me
Trust me
Trust me
Trust me
Trust me

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start things over
And why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over
Why?
I want what I want
I want what I want
I want what I want
I want what I want",Art and Music

How Great Thou Art | The Bonner Family Official Music Video | Christmas With the Chosen
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!  We are joyful that you are joining us for the release of How Great Thou Art, the Bonner Family official Music Video from Christmas With the Chosen: The Messengers Special live event, originally aired on December 1st, 2021.

Christ is the reason why we celebrate and we have needed his love and grace in this world this Christmas season this year.  The lyrics to this timeless spiritual anthem remind us that his art confounds the wise and blesses the meek. We continue to be ""in awesome wonder"" of his miracles. 
For every weary soul within the sound of our voices, we echo the promise that Jesus Christ can and will heal every broken heart, dry every tear and raise us all to live again. Our performance of How Great Thou Art from Christmas with the Chosen: The Messengers will forever remain with us. 

Sending you all the love and peace that Christ offers us, this Christmas and Always!
 ~ Love, The Bonner Family

🎤 Lyrics:

How Great Thou Art

O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.
 
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
 
And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.
 
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

Lyrics:
Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drain me down
That was then and this is now
Now look at me

Chorus:
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

Chorus:
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

Bridge:
Now look at me I’m sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won’t never put me out again
I’m glowing oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don’t mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah yeah, except for me

Chorus:
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no (away from me)
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

This is the part of me (no)
(away from me) This is the part of me
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

Listen to Michael Jackson: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/_listenYD

The short film to Michael Jackson’s “Earth Song,” his best-selling single in the United Kingdom, earned Michael the Doris Day Music Award from the Humane Society’s Genesis Awards.  The urgent need to address the issues facing the planet and all that inhabit it were on the forefront of Michael’s mind when he created this song and short film; issues that are even more urgent today.

Xnt-c5i5prM,The Art of Listening - Music Documentary (2021),"The Art of Listening is a documentary film about the journey music takes to reach a listener’s ear, from the intent of an instrument maker and composer, to the producers and engineers who capture and preserve an artist’s voice. This journey is narrated by intimate conversations with artists, engineers and producers about the philosophy of their work and the intent behind each musical note they create.

This film is an invitation for music fans to rediscover the intricacies and details available in their favorite recordings. The Art of Listening is the beginning of a conversation of how the quality of our listening experiences define the medium.

fi2N5KHgO80,Grimes - Art Angel (Documentary),"Grimes: Art Angel a documentary 

Back in November, Grimes released her technicolor new record, Art Angels. During The FADER's cover story reporting back in the summer, we sat down with Canadian producer/singer Claire Boucher in her Los Angeles home to find out how she's evolved the Grimes project, the misconceptions she has to deal with as a DIY artist, and what's she learnt touring the world.

""At first, I guess, there was just Grimes,"" she says in the documentary. ""I don't technically have control of her narrative anymore—she very much exists in pop culture now. Grimes as one person cannot represent more than a couple of ideas. That's why I started developing some of the other characters, like really abstract from who I am and how I am.""

It's a sound plan, and one that resulted in a fully realized album that details her growth with invigoratingly bold strokes. Last month, we caught up with Boucher once again at her headline Terminal 5 show in New York, where she performed with Taiwanese rapper Aristophanes, who features on Art Angels. Watch them perform in Grimes' FADER Documentary above, and stay tuned for more behind-the-music videos like this one in the new year.

Ls5XWu4PhSs,A World Without Beethoven? | Music Documentary with Sarah Willis (full length),"""What would the world be like without Beethoven?"" That’s the provocative question posed by this music documentary from Deutsche Welle. To answer it, the film explores how Ludwig van Beethoven's innovations continue to have an impact far beyond the boundaries of classical music, 250 years after his birth.

What would be missing from jazz or from film music, for example, if Beethoven had never created his many innovations? Would the concert business exist as we know it today? And how has it changed the role of the artist?

Sarah Willis, horn player with the Berlin Philharmonic, sets out on an entertaining and informative journey in search of answers. She meets people from around the world – musicians, managers and even politicians – to follow the traces of Beethoven’s influence. 

Sarah’s journey begins with the most famous four notes of classical music and their immense influence on pop music. ""It all started with Beethoven,"" says Scorpions guitarist Rudolf Schenker about the preeminent role the composer’s influence has played in the development of the rock riff. Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull) speculates: ""Maybe he just spilled his coffee and it happened to become 'Da-da-da-dum.'"" Jazz trumpeter and Grammy winner Wynton Marsalis explains what Beethoven's last string quartet (No. 16, Op. 135) has to do with the rhythm of jazz. ""Star Wars"" film composer and multiple Oscar winner John Williams praises Beethoven as the master of sounds that create images. And pianist and composer Gabriela Montero adds, ""His music is valid at all times.” 

At the 2022 International Classical Music Awards, ""A World Without Beethoven?"" won the prize in the Video Documentaries category. The jury stated: “A world without Beethoven? It’s simply unimaginable. In Martin Roddewig’s film, the famous horn player Sarah Willis of the Berliner Philharmoniker travels through the realms of rock and classical music, jazz and film scores. In interviews with musicians and managers, the documentary shows how profoundly Beethoven’s innovations have shaped the music of centuries to come. This film is witty and highly entertaining.”

DRI_ZSh6iF4,"The Language Of The New Music - Documentary about Wittgenstein and Schoenberg, 1985","This is a film about Ludwig Wittgenstein and Arnold Schonberg; two men whose lives and ideas run parallel in the development of Viennese radicalism. 
Both men emerged from the turmoil of the Habsburg Empire in its closing days with the idea of analyzing language and purging it with critical intent, believing that in the analysis and purification of language lies the greatest hope that we have.  They never met and might never have fully understood one another, because while the nature of their genius they found themselves alone breaking new ground of the very frontiers of their respective disciplines.  But their work springs from the same soil and shares a common ethical purpose, so that their ideas and methods echo and illuminate those of each other to a remarkable degree.

Absurd, provocative and subversive, Dada began as a response to the madness of World War I. But its radical way of looking at the world inspired generations of artists, writers and musicians, from Monty Python to punk, Bowie to Banksy.

Jim restages an early Dada performance in Zurich's Cabaret Voltaire, where the movement began. Among those joining him in his playful celebration of the Dadaists and their impact are Armando Iannucci, Terry Gilliam, designer Neville Brody and artists Michael Landy and Cornelia Parker.",Art and Music

WBIu15ZIG5Y,Audioslave - The Chris Cornell Story ┃ Documentary,"On July 20, 1964, Christopher John Cornell was born in Seattle, Washington. Although he was born as Christopher John Boyle and would later adopt the surname Cornell from his mother Karen, a self-proclaimed psychic of Jewish descent. 

Chris’s father was of Irish Catholic descent, so Cornell attended a Catholic elementary school during his early years. Cornell was born into a family of 5 siblings and despite attending a strictly religious school, started to show early signs of troublesome behaviour. 

Coming out of the baby boom era of America, Cornell’s neighbourhood was full of other children of all ages. Chris would spend most of his time hanging out with kids older than him and being exposed to darker temptations.

It showed how John Cage prepared pianos, and what he found worked and didn’t, mainly due to the stability of the items added to the strings. Cardew’s work with ‘The Scratch Band’ was also interesting and some of the innovation’s they came up with. They also showed an orchestra of varying ability playing works from the established repertoire, but with notes played incorrectly and out of sequence, thus producing a barely recognizable reproduction of familiar works.

Perhaps most interesting in the field of chance music was a waltz composed by the throw of dice based on a system proposed by Mozart, where numbers related to short motifs of music. They played the short piece at the end, thus creating a work of chance in part created by one of the most brilliant musical minds that ever lived, nearly 200 years before indeterminacy.",Art and Music

JMkV-r_6--o,The Complex Abstractionism Of Pierre Soulages (Full Documentary) | Perspective,"There are two key elements that run throughout Soulages' work: light and color. Here, we're talking about the color black. it was the core of his palette. He felt that black was violent, intense, reactive, and therefore stayed loyal to it throughout his career. Light, although not tangible, was the most important tool in his painting. Here, the play of light transforms and transmutes as the thickness of the paint changes across the work's surface.

Travel in the 18th century greatly impacted some of the finest art ever made. The world was getting smaller and took on new influences shown in the glorious Bavarian pilgrimage architecture, Canaletto's romantic Venice and the blossoming of exotic designs and tastes all over Europe.

Following the grandeur of Baroque, Rococo art is often dismissed as frivolous and unserious, but Waldemar Januszczak disagrees. In this three-part series he re-examines Rococo art and argues that the Rococo was actually the age in which the modern world was born. Picking three key territories of Rococo achievement - travel, pleasure and madness - Waldemar celebrates the finest cultural achievements of the period and examine the drives and underlying meanings that make them so prescient.

MZQnCiUqQ3Y,Norman Rockwell Documentary,"Norman Perceval Rockwell (February 3, 1894 – November 8, 1978) was a 20th-century American author, painter and illustrator. His works enjoy a broad popular appeal in the United States for its reflection of American culture. Rockwell is most famous for the cover illustrations of everyday life he created for The Saturday Evening Post magazine over nearly five decades.[1] Among the best-known of Rockwell's works are the Willie Gillis series, Rosie the Riveter, The Problem We All Live With, Saying Grace, and the Four Freedoms series. He also is noted for his 64-year relationship with the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), during which he produced covers for their publication Boys' Life, calendars, and other illustrations. These works include popular images that reflect the Scout Oath and Scout Law such as The Scoutmaster, A Scout is Reverent[2] and A Guiding Hand,[3] among many others.

Norman Rockwell was a prolific artist, producing more than 4,000 original works in his lifetime. Most of his works are either in public collections, or have been destroyed in fire or other misfortunes. Rockwell also was commissioned to illustrate more than 40 books, including Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn as well as painting the portraits for Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, as well as those of foreign figures, including Gamal Abdel Nasser and Jawaharlal Nehru. His portrait subjects included Judy Garland. One of his last portraits was of Colonel Sanders in 1973. His annual contributions for the Boy Scouts calendars between 1925 and 1976 (Rockwell was a 1939 recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award, the highest adult award given by the Boy Scouts of America[4]), were only slightly overshadowed by his most popular of calendar works: the ""Four Seasons"" illustrations for Brown & Bigelow that were published for 17 years beginning in 1947 and reproduced in various styles and sizes since 1964. He painted six images for Coca-Cola advertising.[5] Illustrations for booklets, catalogs, posters (particularly movie promotions), sheet music, stamps, playing cards, and murals (including ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" and ""God Bless the Hills"", which was completed in 1936 for the Nassau Inn in Princeton, New Jersey) rounded out Rockwell's œuvre as an illustrator.

Rockwell's work was dismissed by serious art critics in his lifetime.[6] Many of his works appear overly sweet in the opinion of modern critics,[7] especially the Saturday Evening Post covers, which tend toward idealistic or sentimentalized portrayals of American life. This has led to the often-deprecatory adjective, ""Rockwellesque"". Consequently, Rockwell is not considered a ""serious painter"" by some contemporary artists, who regard his work as bourgeois and kitsch. Writer Vladimir Nabokov sneered that Rockwell's brilliant technique was put to ""banal"" use, and wrote in his book Pnin: ""That Dalí is really Norman Rockwell's twin brother kidnapped by Gypsies in babyhood"". He is called an ""illustrator"" instead of an artist by some critics, a designation he did not mind, as that was what he called himself.[8]

In his later years, however, Rockwell began receiving more attention as a painter when he chose more serious subjects such as the series on racism for Look magazine.[9] One example of this more serious work is The Problem We All Live With, which dealt with the issue of school racial integration. The painting depicts a young black girl, Ruby Bridges, flanked by white federal marshals, walking to school past a wall defaced by racist graffiti.[10] This painting was displayed in the White House when Bridges met with President Obama in 201",Art and Music

Let’s just say you’re a criminal with millions or even billions of dollars, but you have one big problem: Transferring large sums of money or carrying suitcases of cash will raise eyebrows. You need to “launder” the dough to make the dirty money appear to be clean money, so that then it can be spent anywhere in the world  (say, on real estate, luxury yachts,  strip clubs) no questions asked.
Fear not. With a little financial detergent, your dirty money can become more or less untraceable.
China leads the world in this ancient art. Between 2002 and 2011, some $1.08 trillion departed the country illegally, despite currency-control laws that require people to obtain a permit to exchange more than $50,000 a year worth of yuan into any foreign currency.
But this is a truly international pastime.
Corrupt politicians, drug cartels, alimony deadbeats, nearly everybody’s doing it.
When it comes to money laundering there are three main steps to doing it right:
The first step is… the placement
Placement is the stage when the money enters the financial system for the first time. In this step, the money may be deposited in a bank, added to the accounts of an existing business or disguised as a transaction. 
The placement is usually achieved through a series of regular small transactions. If you are a criminal and you make the mistake of a large amount of cash you are probably gonna get caught right away. 
Of course, many people who attempt money laundering schemes have no past experience and don’t know what behavior is likely to be flagged. This step is widely considered to be the riskiest. If the deposits are scrutinized at this stage, none of the justifications that will exist later in the scheme will yet be in place.
The second step of money laundering is the Layering
Layering is the stage where the illicit money is put together with legitimate money or placed in constant motion. Layering usually involves generating so many intricate transactions that the dirty cash disappears into them. Illicit money can be used to gamble, then placed into stocks, then shuffled around in different currencies and then used to buy financial products like life insurance policies.   
Layering can work in dramatically different ways depending on the scheme. In all schemes, however, the purpose of the layering stage is to make it difficult for even a skilled accountant to differentiate between money that came from legal transactions and money that came from funds that were placed for laundering.
While layering is typically a safer stage than placement, those who are not careful often can still be caught easily if they make mistakes. For example, if a business that averaged $5,000 in transactions a day for years were to suddenly start processing $10,000 in transactions a day, it might attract scrutiny.
The 3rd and last step is integration
Integration is the stage where the money re-enters the legitimate economy. When the money appears to come from legal businesses or investments, or the trail has become too difficult to follow, the money can then be placed into larger-scale investments.
Integrated cash is often placed into luxurious assets, properties, long-term investments, and new businesses. Integrated cash may be used to purchase assets that can be used to facilitate future money laundering more safely. 

Examples of Money Laundering

There are several types of money laundering, like casino schemes, cash business schemes, smurfing schemes, and foreign investment schemes. 
A complete money laundering operation will often involve more than one as the money is moved around to avoid detection. For instance, proceeds from cash businesses can be gambled, just as the “success” of a cash business that has been infused with placed cash can be used to justify investments or loans, which come from cash placed offshore.

QpeWTkVmUcY,The healing power of music - How does music impact us? | DW Documentary,"Music affects all levels of the human brain, and directly affects our emotions. Music shapes us in the womb, touches us deeply and can even drive us to perform at our peak. And it can help us to live healthier and happier lives.

Neuroscientists like Peter Vuust and Stefan Kölsch are researching the secrets of rhythms and melodies by studying how our brains function and develop. From the University of Bergen in Norway, Stefan Kölsch believes that music may help our bodies to activate healing powers better than many drugs can.

When we cook, we hum along to pop songs on the radio. We clap to the beat when a particularly groovy song comes on. Peter Vuust from the Music in the Brain Institute in Aarhus, Denmark, has researched the secret of the groove and knows why there are some songs we just can't sit still to.

In sports, high-energy beats can also motivate better performance. Tom Fritz from the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig has discovered that if we produce the music ourselves during training, we are even more effective. This documentary examines the positive influence music has on us - from infancy to old age.

Along with Christianity, the Dark Ages saw the emergence of another religion — Islam. After emerging in the Near East, it spread across North Africa and into Europe in such a short time that there was originally no art. In more settled times, highly decorated mosques began to be built based on the prophet Mohammad's own home. Their architectural and scientific achievements, including the mapping of the stars, dwarfed anything existing in the western world. 

Januszczak visits the Dome of the Rock, desert palaces forgotten by modern Islam with their more sensual artwork, the Mosque of Ibn Tulun where it was believed Noah's Ark landed, and the Mosque of Cordoba. He identifies the Nilometer used to measure the flood of the Nile and uses an astrolabe that Muslims used to find the direction of Mecca.

At the beginning of the 20th century, a new direction in music appeared in America. Although the word ""jazz"" came into use only in 1913, this music, distinguished by its loudness, audacity, and riot, was heard on the streets of New Orleans at least ten years earlier. Jazz possessed special rhythmic energy never seen before in folk music. In addition, jazz was bold and unpredictable - the same song sounded different with each performance, and this only made jazz attractive. The musicians improvised, following the inspiration and adapting the melody to the sounds of other instruments playing with them on stage.

d4DMMycMphk,How The Impressionists Escaped The Studio (Waldemar Januszczak Documentary) | Perspective,"Subscribe and click the bell icon to get more arts content every week:

Waldemar Januszczak continues his investigation of the Impressionists by taking us outdoors to their most famous locations. Although Impressionist pictures often look sunny and relaxed, achieving this peaceful air was hard work. Trudging through fog, wind and rain, across treacherous coastal rocks and knee-deep snow, Waldemar shows how the famous spontaneity of the Impressionists is thoroughly misleading.

This episode visits the French riverside locations that Monet loved to paint, and where Renoir captured the bonhomie of modern life. Waldemar also introduces a number of technical and practical developments of the age which completely revolutionised Impressionist painting - the invention of portable easels; the use of hog's hair in paint brushes; as well as the introduction of the railway through France. And a scientific demonstration in a Swedish snowdrift explains just how right the Impressionists were to paint brightly coloured shadows in their winter scenes, despite being accused of 'hallucinating' at the time.

Finally, Januszczak explains Cezanne's part in the Impressionist story from his dark and challenging early work to his first rural landscapes in France, and then his departure from Paris and separation from the Impressionist gang.

lyyaYrt18Pg,"Dark Ages, An Age Of Light: Islamic Magnificent Art (Waldemar Januszczak Documentary) | TRACKS","The Dark Ages have been misunderstood. History has identified the period following the fall of the Roman Empire with a descent into barbarism - a terrible time when civilisation stopped. Waldemar Januszczak disagrees. In this four-part series he argues that the Dark Ages were a time of great artistic achievement, with new ideas and religions provoking new artistic adventures.

பழங்காலத்து இசை கருவிகளை தேடும் பயணத்தில் இருந்த நான், கண்டறிந்து வியந்த ஓர் பொக்கிஷம், திருப்பூர் குன்னத்தூர் சேர்ந்த திரு அருணாச்சலம் அவர்கள். அனைவராலும் கின்னாரம் தாத்தா என அழைக்கப்படும் இவரை அறிமுகப்படுத்துவதில் எம் பரம் பரா நிறுவனத்திற்கு பெருமையும் மனநிறைவும் ஒருங்கேயுள்ளது. 63 வயதான இவர், சுமார் 50 வருடங்களாக கின்னாரம் வாசித்தும், அருகில் இருக்கும் ஊர்களில் சென்று பாட்டு படித்தும் வாழ்க்கை நடத்திவருகிறார்.குறிப்பாக, கோவலன் கண்ணகி காப்பிய கதையை உச்சத்சாயில் பாடி பிரமிக்கவைக்கிறார்.  தற்போது,  உலகில்  வாழும்  ஒரே  பாணர்  கலையான   கின்னாரம்  இசைக்கும்  ஒரே  கலைஞர்  இவரே.கின்னார சுரைக்காய் மற்றும் மூங்கில் கொண்டு தானே இசைக்கருவி செய்து வாழும் இக்கலைஞரின் வாழ்வாதாரம் கவலைக்குரியதே. மேட்சி போற்றவேண்டிய ஓர் கலைஞர், கொண்டாடப்படவேண்டிய அவரின் வரலாறு கேட்பாரில்லாமல் இருப்பது இவரின்

தேடல் தொடரும்....

On a quest to find the ancient music instruments, we found a gem hailing in Kunnathur, Tirupur District. We from “ParramParra” proudly present Mr. Aranachalam, Kinnaram artist in nandhavanam, kunnathur, from the district of tirupur. This 63 year old, ancient folk-lore artist astounded us with his impeccable instrument and soul-stirring singing.  
Mr Aranachalam, a renowned musician in his village for playing ‘Kovalan-Kannagi’ historical tale popularly known Silapadhigaram for about 50 years now, for the past three generations. His musical embraces hours and at times days of singing (the profession called as “PAANAR”- one who sings, in olden times) that was appreciably mastered from his father and grandfather through word of mouth in his teen age. Even though the song be short of written format, he sings miraculously with his deep rooted passion for the instrument and inheritance. 
When asked, why he didn’t go to school, Aranachalam smilingly commented he liked to play Kinnaram more than studies. It is exceptional that we find the kind of passion he holds involving crafting the instrument from scratch using earth supplies including vegetables like Dried White Pumpkin and Bamboo, miles of walking to go to remote villages, sing for hours and days, and earn a living in spite of living options other than music that was offered to him. At present, Mr Aranachalam, is the last-known Kinnaram artist in this world. Though his appearance seems majestic with a head turban and sound voice, his way of living is humble in a hut with meagre provision of sustenance. We, from “Parram Parra” have commenced this documentary as a path to help this legendary artist for his life of passion to art and music. We also sincerely commit to spread this lovely art to the globe by all means. We humbly request you all to help these folk artists wherever possible as they are our history, a priceless possession that we should celebrate, to our best support!

The Quest continues….
